<p>The next personage of whom some detached
and mutilated memorandums present themselves,
must be an object of conjecture, but the peculiarities
concerning him are very striking, and the
changes of his character and conduct so very considerable,
that it may not be unamusing to some
readers, to look back on the last twenty-five years,
and endeavour to discover to whom they will
apply.</p>

<p>The individual alluded to in our Manuscript, is
mentioned as having been educated in the principles
of the Dissenters, and to have officiated in
earlier life as a clerk in some manufactory, or
with some merchant, at Liverpool. It may be
questioned, whether he ever entirely got rid of his
former prejudices, but on some occasion or other,
he chose to offer himself to the Bishop of Landaff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
as a candidate for orders. By him he was ordained,
and he rendered himself so acceptable to the Bishop,
that he made him his Chaplain. Preferment he had
none to give him, at least no opportunity of making
provision for his Chaplain presented itself, and the
subject of this article was for a long series of years
confined to a scanty income, obtained from laborious
curacies, and from the not much more tolerable
labour of pen-drudgery for booksellers.</p>

<p>With his entrance into holy orders, the spirit of
orthodoxy and loyalty did not immediately accompany
him. His more intimate associates were still
those, who, on all occasions, avowed and practised
hostility to the Established Church, and friendship
for French principles; and he so far forgot himself,
that for a time, at least, he was an active member
of the famous, or rather infamous, Corresponding
Society. His very particular friends were Mr.
Stone, Helen Maria Williams, Mr. Holcroft, Mrs.
Wolstoncroft, Dr. Priestley, Dr. Kippis—<i>et id
genus omne</i>.</p>

<p>In this interval he published sermons, which were
well received, some essays, rather heavy, but which
indicated powers of thinking. He translated a
very popular theological work, and this with so
much success, that it introduced him to the notice
of an excellent and venerable prelate, who has before
been named, and who always eagerly sought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
opportunities of distinguishing and rewarding literary
exertions, particularly such as promised to be
useful to the Church.</p>

<p>Our gentleman had then the discretion to withdraw
his name from the above-mentioned society,
and demonstrated a little more circumspection,
with respect to those with whom he associated.
He however married a rigid Dissenter, to whom he
eventually owed the prosperity, which attended his
close of life.</p>

<p>By a concurrent series of fortunate circumstances,
he was finally introduced to the Premier, and employed
by him in some confidential services. The
consequence of this was preferment so considerable
as to secure a perfect independence.</p>

<p>His publications were very numerous, and he had
obtained a sort of name among publishers, which
occasioned many manuscripts of authors to be confided
to him for revision and correction. Among
others, he superintended the very popular work by
Colonel Drinkwater, on the siege of Gibraltar.
It is, however, to be apprehended, that he sometimes
allowed his name to be prefixed, when he had
not a great deal to do with the substance and body
of the work.</p>

<p>And so much for Dr. ⸺.</p>

</div>

<p>The vicissitudes of fortune, of principles, and of
conduct, which characterised the individual above
introduced, not improbably brought to the recollection
of the Sexagenarian, another personage of still
more eccentric and contradictory qualities. For
immediately succeeding the above sketch, after the
erasure of some lines, in which occur the words
<i>inconsistency</i>, <i>unprincipled</i>, <i>uncommonly good luck</i>,
we find the following observations:—</p>

<p>I have often regretted that on leaving his society,
I did not constantly write down the good things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
said by <span class="smcap">John Wilkes</span>. I transcribe from memory
these few particulars concerning him, and I may
perhaps hereafter increase the catalogue.</p>

<p>He was really a sad dog, but most delightfully
amusing, facetious, witty, well-informed, and with
much various, though not profound learning.</p>

<p>He was sometimes so intolerably sarcastic, and
more particularly at the expence of his friends in
the city, that the wonder is, how he could so long
continue in their good graces. He never put any
restraint upon himself, when in company, on the
other side of Temple-bar, but indulged in all the
satire of his wit, at the citizen’s expence. A few
examples, among a hundred that could easily be
given, may suffice.</p>

<p>When confined in the King’s Bench, he was
waited upon by a deputation from some ward in
the city, when the office of alderman was vacant.
As there had already been great fermentation on
his account, and much more apprehended, they who
were deputed, undertook to remonstrate with
Wilkes on the danger to the public peace, which
would result from his offering himself as a candidate
on the present occasion, and expressed the
hope that he would at least wait till some more
suitable opportunity presented itself. But they
mistook their man; this was with him an additional
motive for persevering in his first intentions. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
much useless conversation, one of the deputies at
length exclaimed, “Well, Mr. Wilkes, if you are
thus determined, we must take the sense of the
ward.” “With all my heart,” replied Wilkes, “I
will take the non-sense, and beat you ten to one.”</p>

<p>Upon another occasion, Wilkes attended a city
dinner, not long after his promotion to city-honours.
Among the guests was a noisy vulgar deputy, a
great glutton, who, on his entering the dinner room,
always with great deliberation took off his wig, suspended
it on a pin, and with due solemnity put on
a white cotton night-cap. Wilkes, who certainly
was a high-bred man, and never accustomed to
similar exhibitions, could not take his eyes from so
strange and novel a picture. At length, the deputy,
with unblushing familiarity, walked up to Wilkes,
and asked him whether he did not think that his
night-cap became him? “Oh! Yes, Sir,” replied
Wilkes, “but it would look much better if it was
pulled quite over your face.”</p>

<p>Wilkes’s dislike of the Scotch was sufficiently
notorious, yet he was very partial to Boswell, and
often sought his society. I dined with him once,
(<i>loquitur Sexagenarius noster</i>) when, among some
enlightened people, was present a heavy, stupid,
consequential fellow, who held some city office, and
who often, in the course of the conversation, treated
Wilkes with much rudeness. It seemed that Wilkes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and Boswell had met in Italy, and had ascended to
the top of Vesuvius together. They recapitulated
various circumstances of their expedition with much
pleasantness and good-humour: and among other
things, Boswell reminded Wilkes, with no ordinary
satisfaction, of the exquisite Lacryma Christi, which
they had found at a hermitage for the accommodation
of travellers, half-way up the mountain: “Pray
brother Wilkes,” said the citizen, “what is Lacryma
Christi?” The answer which is here omitted, joined
the most perfect wit, to the grossest blasphemy.</p>

<p>But neither would Wilkes spare Boswell, or
conceal before him his prejudices against the Scotch
nation. He seemed to seize, with particular avidity,
every opportunity to play upon Boswell, when
any thing relating to Scotland was introduced.
“You must acknowledge, my friend Wilkes,” observed
Boswell one day, “that the approach to
Edinburgh from the London road, presents a very
picturesque and interesting picture.” “Why so it
perhaps may,” returned Wilkes, “but when I
was there, the wind was in my face, and it brought
with it such a confounded stink, that I was obliged
to keep my handkerchief to my nose, the whole
of the way, and could see nothing of the prospect.”</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, Boswell was speaking of
some Scotch nobleman, who was very fond of planting,
and had ornamented his domain with some very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
fine and beautiful forest-trees. “Where could this
possibly be,” said Wilkes; “I travelled through the
country with an American servant, and after we had
visited various places in different parts of Scotland,
I enquired of him what his general opinion was of
the country?” “Oh, Sir!” replied the American,
“it is <i>finely cleared</i>.”</p>

<p>There was a heavy Lord Mayor in Wilkes’s time,
who, by persevering steadily in the pursuit of one
object, accumulated an immense fortune, and rose
progressively from the dignity of Common-councilman
to the State-coach, and the Mansion-house. His
first entrance into life was as a common bricklayer.
At one of the Old Bailey dinners, his lordship, after
a sumptuous repast on turbot and venison, was eating
an immense quantity of butter with his cheese—“Why
brother,” said Wilkes, “you lay it on with
a <i>trowel</i>.”</p>

<p>There is a singular anecdote of this same Lord
Mayor, demonstrative of the parsimonious principles,
by the exercise of which he doubtless rose to
opulence. His only son was brought up in the
same mean profession, and one day fell from a scaffold,
and was killed by the fall. The father, who was
present, on seeing the accident, only exclaimed,
“Take care of his watch.”</p>

<p>In the riots of the year 1780, which at the same
time endangered and disgraced the metropolis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Wilkes was lamenting the ungovernable violence
of a London mob;—upon this, some brother citizen
took him up shortly, and reminded him of the
disturbances of which he had formerly been the
occasion. “Sir,” returned Wilkes, “I never was
a Wilkite.”</p>

<p>He was not apt to express outwardly any thing
like chagrin or mortification, but he certainly took
his disappointment at Brentford, the last time that
he offered himself as candidate for Middlesex, very
heavily to heart. “I should much have liked,”
he would say, “to have died in my geers.” Upon
a similar occasion he exclaimed, “I can only compare
myself to an exhausted volcano.”</p>

<p>Among other peculiarities and contradictions
which marked Wilkes’s character, was a passion he
had for collecting bibles, of which he had certainly
obtained a great number of curious editions. But
he was nevertheless consistent in his profligacy,
and whenever the subject of religion or scripture
was introduced, treated both with the keenest ridicule.</p>

<p>He called one morning upon a friend who resided
in a very close and retired situation in the city, but
who had a small opening before his house, of a few
yards square, and two plants, which once looked
like lilacs, in large tubs, adorned his windows.
Men were employed in painting the outside of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
house. “Brother,” said Wilkes to his friend,
“suffer me to plead in behalf of these two poor
lilacs in the tubs; pray let them be painted too.”</p>

<p>Wilkes was particularly fond of the society of
learned men, though not by any means profoundly
erudite himself. On some distinguished Greek
scholar being named to him, he expressed a great
desire to have his acquaintance. “Pray make me
know him,” says Wilkes, “and tell him I should
very much like pergræcari<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with him.” To which
the person alluded to would have made no kind of
objection.</p>

<p>There were other broken and unfinished scraps
in the Manuscript about Wilkes, which in appearance
were intended to revive the recollection of
circumstances to be detailed at some hour of
leisure. There is, however, this remark at the
end.</p>

<p>Wilkes was of that distinguished eminence for
facetiousness and humour, it may indeed be said
for wit, that it was the fashion of the day to ascribe
any very striking and popular bon mot to him, and
about the time of his disappearing from the stage,
to him or Jekyll. They have both, in all probability,
had the reputation of saying what neither of
them ever uttered; though both were eminently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
distinguished for saying naturally and unaffectedly
innumerable good things.</p>

<p>A few of these children of questionable parentage
are preserved. No matter to which of the above,
or to whom, they belong.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Querist.—Where, observed a Roman Catholic,
in warm dispute with a Protestant, where was your

<p>Q. Did you wash your face this morning?</p>

<p>A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. Where was your face before it was washed?</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I wish you at the devil, said somebody to Wilkes.</p>

<p>I don’t wish you there.</p>

<p>Why.</p>

<p>Because I never wish to meet you again.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Where the devil do you come from? said Wilkes,
to a beggar in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>From the devil.</p>

<p>What is there going on there?</p>

<p>Much the same as here.</p>

<p>What’s that?</p>

<p>The rich taken in, and the poor kept out.</p>

</div>

<p>The following may with greater probability be
assigned to Jekyll than to Wilkes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Your friend N. is married.</p>

<p>To whom?</p>

<p>The tall Miss G.</p>

<p>What to that thin lankey piece of furniture: it
could not be from the lust of the flesh, for she has
not an ounce upon her.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>At a dinner where great satisfaction was expressed,
it was facetiously proposed that the president
should proceed to the kitchen, and kiss the
cook.</p>

<p>That, observed ⸺, would be a salute at Spithead.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When a certain popular nobleman was appointed
to the green ribband, he met his facetious friend,
who warmly congratulated him on his new dignity,
and green ribband. Yes, said the nobleman, but
you will find me the same man still. Why, then
returned the wit, you shall be the Green Man and
Still.</p>

<p>A pert young lady was walking one morning on
the Steyne, at Brighton, when she encountered our
facetious friend. You see, Mr. ⸺, I am come
out for a little sun and air.</p>

<p>You had better, Madam, get a little husband
first.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>The above are a few of the facetious apopthegms,
which seemed, in the opinion of the Sexagenarian
to merit preservation. There are others in the
Manuscript, but they are either more familiar, or
less interesting. Contrasted to the above, are two
extraordinary instances of ignorance, which appear
to have been written down as marvellous examples
of a total want of comprehension and intelligence.</p>

<p>A woman of decent appearance came into a stationer’s
shop, where the Sexagenarian was present,
and desired to purchase a pen, for which she paid
a penny. On receiving it, she returned it with the
observation, that it was good for nothing. Another
was given her, but she gave this also back again,
with the same remark. On being asked what fault
she had to find with them—“Why how,” she returned,
“could they possibly be good for any
thing, when both had a slit at the end.”</p>

<p>The other instance is no less curious, and also
happened in the presence of our friend.</p>

<p>A female came into a bookseller’s shop with a
slip of paper in her hand, upon which was written
a verse from Scripture, with the proper reference to
the place from whence it was taken.</p>

<p>“I want,” said she, “<i>the sermon</i> on that text,
and two of my neighbours will each be glad of one
also.” The bookseller surprised, enquired whose
sermon it was. “Our curate’s,” she replied,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
“and he preached it last Sunday.” On being
asked whether she knew if it had been printed,
she was a little displeased, and pettishly observed,
“how could it be preached if it had not been
printed.” No explanation or remonstrance availed
to satisfy, and she left the shop, convinced that the
bookseller could, if he had thought proper, have accommodated
her with what she wanted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

</div>

<p>A literary life, like adversity, introduces a
man to strange and opposite acquaintance. Genius,
talent, and learning, are not limited to rank or station,
and the ingenuous desire of receiving, as well
as of communicating information, induces an individual
of such propensities to put aside those prejudices,
which marked differences of opinion in
creeds and in politics, have an inavoidable tendency
to excite. That such were the feelings, and such the
circumstances of our venerable friend, at a certain
period of his life, appear from the following loose
memoranda, which he evidently intended, at some
period or other, to arrange and methodize.</p>

<p>What shall that individual alledge, to ward off
and repel the charge of inconsistency, who began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
his career in life under the auspices of James Townsend,
of Bruce Castle, of the patriotic Aldermen Sawbridge
and Oliver; who confesses that he spent
agreeable hours with Price and Priestley, and Horne
Tooke, and Major Cartwright; and Kippis; and afterwards
with a well known popular Baronet, and
Dr. Disney, and Walker of Liverpool, and very
many others of this description. The same person in
the decline of life, had no friends, associates, or indeed
acquaintance, but with individuals whose principles,
sentiments, and conduct, were as diametrically
opposite, to those of the characters above
named, as light to darkness.</p>

<p>The fact is to be thus explained:—The first entrance
into life must be incidental altogether; our
first connexions are unavoidably those of our relatives,
and their friends and associates; principles
are unfolded only by time and experience, and then
it is, that intimacies and attachments are formed
and confirmed by similarity of taste, sentiments,
and pursuits. Our Sexagenarian, as appears from
his notes, first lived, where almost the whole of
what might properly be denominated taste and
learning, was confined to the Dissenters. Mark,
reader, not Methodists; never was much taste or
learning visible among these sectaries, but among
the old Presbyterians, who constituted, in the place
alluded to, both a numerous and respectable class.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Neither did the word Presbyterian by any means
imply “an immoral man, a pestilent citizen, or a
disloyal subject.” He was therefore and of necessity
compelled, though firm and immoveable in his
own religious tenets, to associate much and familiarly
with them in order to participate in common
in the literary barter, which was carried on
with much fairness and liberality on all sides.</p>

<p>Afterwards having formed a tender domestic connection,
the ramification from which, drew him not
unwilling to the metropolis; his family engagements
threw him abruptly, and in the heat of the American
war, amidst “a croud of patriots,” many of whose
names have before been mentioned. Young and inexperienced,
dazzled with the name of liberty, confounded
by subtleties of argument, which, if he
could not accurately analyze, he was still unable to
confute; and lastly, with the prospect placed before
him of ease and independence, can it excite surprise,
that he should get entangled in a net, of which
the meshes were at the same time so fine, as to
elude detection, and too strong to allow of escape?</p>

<p>Politics, however, was not the subject for which
he was best qualified, nor did they ever interest his
affections, or exercise the better powers of his mind.
He was rather the instrument than the operator,
and he confesses that he has often looked back with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
a sort of shame and compunction, at having been,
sometimes, the means of circulating ingredients, of
the full tendency of which he was then unconscious,
but which he has since ascertained to have developed
some of those poisonous seeds, the pernicious effects
of which, Europe, nay the whole world, has for
the last five and twenty years experienced.</p>

<p>He derives, however, some consolation from the
hope, indeed the confident belief, that many of those
individuals, to whom a chain of fortuitous circumstances
thus introduced him, were not themselves
aware of the ultimate consequences of their conduct.
The spirit of distrust and suspicion, which, in our
free country, always follows with unremitting vigilance,
the measures and the ministers of government,
the emotions of wounded pride, of disappointed ambition,
and, in some instances of personal enmity,
combined to form the stimulus which actuated the
conduct of many of the best and ablest characters
among them. Many also, it is apprehended, discovered
the illusion in time, and retracted their
errors, before they had operated to the injury of
their country.</p>

<p>Be the above as it may, the whole of the junta
has disappeared like “the baseless fabric of a
vision,” and of the individuals more particularly
alluded to, the writer of these pages was, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
this was recorded, the “only rack which was left
behind.”</p>

<p>It may not be altogether unentertaining to say
a little on some of these worthies, the result of personal
knowledge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

</div>

<p>James T. of B. Castle, was the most extraordinary
character of them all. He was of a good
family, his father having been an opulent merchant,
Alderman of London, and Member of Parliament.
Whether this gentleman had that determined and
implacable spirit of resistance to the measures of
government, which afterwards characterized his son,
has not been recorded. This James T.’s first appearance
as a candidate for political fame, was when
he served the office of Sheriff, with Sawbridge, and
perhaps the same office has never since been filled
by such individuals, possessing, in such entire unison,
qualities so eccentric. It is not intended to
write T.’s life, though it deserves a place in our biographical
collections, far better than many which
there make their appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>The principal upon which he seemingly acted, was
to resist government in every thing, though this was
hardly fair on the score of gratitude. He married
a natural daughter of the last Lord C. who left Mrs.
T. all his estates, which were very large indeed,
but as she had been born abroad, and had never
been naturalized, the estates were forfeited to the
crown. The then Lord Holland had an intimate
political connection with Mr. T.’s father, and
through his parliamentary interest, the estates were
restored to Lord C.’s daughter, and confirmed to
her by act of Parliament.</p>

<p>This liberality had, however, no sort of influence
on his conduct; his own opinion on any subject was
the standard of right, and <i>fari quid sentiat</i>, his motto.
During the time of his serving the office of Sheriff,
it was thought expedient by government to execute
some rioters in Spital-fields, in the neighbourhood
where the offence had been committed. This he
and his brother Sheriff strenuously resisted, contending
they were not justified in seeing the sentence
of the law put in force, except at the usual
place of execution. They were, however, obliged
to give way. Upon another occasion, he resisted
the payment of the land-tax, and suffered his effects
to be seized at T. from the excuse that in the case
of Wilkes and Lutterell, the county of Middlesex
was not legally represented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>He had great natural eloquence, though he had
not taken much pains in the cultivation of his mind;
and he always commanded attention in the House of
Commons, where he once very narrowly escaped being
sent to the Tower, in consequence of some intemperate
expressions against the Princess Dowager of
Wales. His most particular friends were Lord
Shelburne and Colonel Barré. He represented
Calne, Lord Shelburne’s borough, and when in
town, always resided in his Lordship’s house.
Whatever may be thought of his politics, though
they certainly were of a mischievous tendency, he
was a firm and steady friend, and so tenacious of
his promise, that he would leave the remotest part
of the kingdom, and the most delightful society, to
attend and give his vote at Guildhall, though for
the meanest individual, and the humblest office.
He was very proud and tenacious of his dignity
among the great, though of the most conciliating
affability with his inferiors. He would travel from
one end of the kingdom to the other without a servant,
and with a small change of linen in a leathern
trunk behind the saddle.</p>

<p>The Sexagenarian once accompanied him on a fishing
excursion, in a remote province, and he chose, in
the kitchen of the village-alehouse, where they stopped
for refreshment, to dress some of the fish that
had been caught. A labouring man came in to enquire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
of the landlord how to get a letter to London
<i>at least expence</i>. “Give me your letter,” said
Mr. T. “and it shall cost nothing.” He accordingly
asked for pen and ink, and franked it, to the
great amazement of seven or eight peasants, who
were standing about to see the novel spectacle of a
Gemman dressing his own fish.</p>

<p>A great deal more might be said, and not without
exciting interest, of this singular character, but it
appears that our friend’s memorandums must be
curtailed; they would otherwise extend to too great
a length. With the exception of Lord Shelburne
and Colonel Barré, Mr. T.’s political friends varied
somewhat with times and circumstances. He was
once very intimate with Lord Thurlow, with Horne
Tooke, with Sawbridge, and Oliver, and Wilkes,
and many similar characters of that day, but before
his death, these connections ceased altogether.</p>

<p>His son, it seems, partook of his father’s enthusiasm,
or what they mutually understood to be
the cause of liberty, and attached himself to the
flaming patriots of the day.</p>

<p>The London Aldermen of those days, at least it
is true of many among them, were in some respects
different from those of the present. There were
not a few individuals of birth and fortune, but little
connected with commerce, who used their influence
to obtain the Aldermanic gown, entirely from political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
views and purposes; such was Mr. T. and such
also was Sawbridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Sawbridge was a country gentleman, with
no city connections, but ardent in his politics, and
exasperated against government, for what he considered
as a violation of the constitution, in not
permitting Wilkes to sit as representative for Middlesex.
He at that time sate in Parliament for
one of the Cinque Ports, and so distinguished himself
by the part he took in favour of Wilkes, that
he became exceedingly popular with the citizens of
London, who, before he was an Alderman, elected
him with T, to the office of Sheriff. He was in
due time both Alderman and Lord Mayor, and
afterwards represented the city of London in three
succeeding parliaments.</p>

<p>He was a violent and constant opposer of the
American war, and a systematic advocate for parliamentary
reform; and during the whole of the
time that he had a seat in the house, he never
failed to make an annual motion to shorten the
duration of parliament.</p>

<p>He was a perfect gentleman in his manners, and
very little calculated to assimilate with those, into
whose intimate society, his political enmities and
prejudices introduced him.</p>

<p>Another of this circle was Mr. Oliver; he was a
West India merchant, and in his external manners,
the perfect gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>The circumstance which first introduced him to
city honours and political importance, was alike
whimsical and accidental. He had a brother, who,
on some vacancy for the representation of London,
had declared himself a candidate with much prospect
of success. He was, however, seized with a
violent and dangerous sickness, which prevented
his appearing on the hustings on the day of nomination.
On this day, however, Mr. Richard Oliver,
the subject of the present sketch, presented
himself to the citizens, and lamented that the condition
of his brother’s health rendered it impossible
for him to avail himself of the honours which
probably awaited him; but that he who now addressed
them, attached to the same party, governed
by the same principles, and possessed of equal independence,
begged them to transfer the kindness
they meditated for his brother, to himself. He succeeded
without opposition, and in the interval between
the day of nomination and election, was
chosen an Alderman, and was afterwards Lord
Mayor.</p>

<p>Of all the political popular characters of his day,
Mr. Oliver, perhaps, was most consistently tenacious
of the principles which he first avowed. This
he exemplified more particularly with respect to
Wilkes. As soon as he began to suspect that
Wilkes was actuated by other motives, and had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
other views beyond those which they vindicated
and pursued in common, he withdrew himself entirely
from the Connection, and obstinately refused
to serve the office of Sheriff with Wilkes as a colleague.</p>

<p>Some few years afterwards, and towards the
conclusion of the American war, in despair, as he
observed in a speech to the Corporation of London,
of seeing greater wisdom in the measures of government,
he resigned both his Aldermanic gown and
seat in Parliament. He then went to visit his
estate in the West Indies, where, after remaining
some time, he proceeded on his return to England,
and died in the voyage on board the packet.</p>

<p>Very different from the above individuals in almost
every particular, was <span class="smcap">Brass Crosby</span>, of
whom there is hardly any thing more memorable,
than that with Oliver, he demonstrated considerable
firmness in the affair of the Printers, and was with
him committed to the Tower, for a supposed breach
of the privileges of parliament. But he was a man
of no talents, of coarse appearance, and rude
manners.</p>

<p>To the above conclave also belonged <span class="smcap">Richard
Beckford</span>, a natural son of the celebrated Alderman
Beckford, and a mighty lover of liberty; but
he was also no less famous as a lover of something
else, and that was of eating and drinking. If there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
shall be any one surviving who personally knew, and
can remember him, they will allow that seldom has
a more worthy candidate been seen for a place at
the Round Table of the Knights of Heliogabalus.</p>

<p>His prowess in this way was enormous. If he
had only two bottles of Madeira at dinner, he
thought himself stinted, and even after a more
copious portion, would not unfrequently go in the
evening to some of the fashionable club-houses in
the vicinity of St. James’s-street, and repeat the
dose. He was a remarkably large uncouth man,
and had a convulsive infirmity in his head and
neck, which made conversation with him exceedingly
unpleasant.</p>

<p>Of Colonel Barré and Lord Shelburne, it must
be unnecessary to say any thing. They might be
considered as the fulcrum, upon which this political
association rested; but there is one individual of
whom it may be expedient to say a little more, and
this was G⸺e B⸺s. He was a most perfect,
noisy, turbulent demagogue; a great clamourer for
liberty, and like all such, sour, surly, and tyrannical
in his own family. He expressed a great contempt
for women generally, and appeared to have
had a remarkable aversion to what are considered
as female accomplishments. In consequence of
these absurd prejudices, he was particularly harsh
to his wife and daughters, and refused the latter the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
opportunity of acquiring the commonest and more
essential attainments. They trembled at his appearance,
and exulted, with unaffected satisfaction,
whenever any unexpected incident detained him
from his family.</p>

<p>He was what in city language is termed a Deputy,
that is, the representative of the alderman of
the ward, in his absence. He was a man of strong
sense, and by flattering his vanity, he was found
exceedingly useful to his party at Common Halls,
Courts of Common Council, and Ward Meetings.
It was the fashion of that day, and it appears to
have continued to the present period, to insult Royalty
by insolent attacks, under the names of petitions
and remonstrances. On such occasions, the personage
here alluded to was always a conspicuous
performer.</p>

<p>He had a son, who, bating that he inherited his
paternal foibles, as they related to party and politics,
was a sensible and accomplished gentleman.
He, however, died prematurely.</p>

<p>There were other individuals of this fraternity,
but of less notorious importance. The ligature,
however, which held them all together, was first
weakened, and finally dissolved.</p>

</div>

<p>It can hardly be a matter of astonishment, that
from mixing a great deal with the above individuals,
and as well from family connection, as from repeated
assurances of independence, the mind of a
young and inexperienced man, should in some degree
be warped. That he should in some measure
feel a favourable bias towards sentiments and prejudices,
which he heard perpetually avowed by many
whom he esteemed, and vindicated not only with
no ordinary degree of subtlety, but with the greatest
powers of argument and intellect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>The delusion, however, did not last long. The
fervour of political association, and the dreams of
anticipated affluence, were abruptly but effectually
dissolved. The golden image of independence was
only seen through a glass darkly, and at a prodigious
distance. It became necessary, steadily and
diligently to exercise such abilities as were possessed,
to fulfil the sweetest of charities, and the most sacred
of obligations.</p>

<p>Whilst the mind was still in an unsettled state,
and the imagination bewildering itself in visions of
fancied occupation, accident (of all accidents surely
the most fortunate) placed in the way an individual,
to delineate whose character with fidelity and truth,
though a most delightful task, yet it is one which
requires no ordinary talents—no slight attention.</p>

<p>This occurrence, and this individual, gave a decided
bias to the future pursuits, studies, views, connections,
and prospects of the Sexagenarian. The influence
was like that of an ascendant star, nor ever
did one dark cloud interpose between this star and
the object, which with complacency and affection,
contemplated its mild and benignant aspect. Two
streams united, which together formed a river,
gentle but far from dull, and full without overflowing.
Quickness of conception on one side, was
tempered by judicious deliberation on the other;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
luxuriance of expression was chastened by classical
accuracy, and extreme facility of communicating
ideas, was moderated and reined in, by a salutary
sobriety and reserve.</p>

<p>At first, indeed, there seemed something like an
impassable gulf between the parties, formed by the
undisguised exhibition of the qualities of mind by
which they were severally distinguished. The first
rencontre, for so it may be called, happened at the
period, when the popularity of Mrs. Siddons, was
at its height. The Sexagenarian, warm, impetuous,
and living in much intimacy with the family of
Mr. and Mrs. Yates, of theatrical memory, contended
for the superiority of his friend and favourite,
and considered the excellence of Mrs. Siddons,
as solely consisting in the knowledge of her art,
without exciting or displaying the great features
and impressive emotions of nature. On the other
hand, it was argued with equal pertinacity, that
Mrs. Siddons had much higher and stronger claims
to admiration, and that her popularity was the result
of feeling, co-operating with judgment. As usual,
neither party was convinced by the argument of his
opponent, and they parted not very well satisfied
with one another. But the reserve occasioned by
this jarring of sentiments soon wore off, and disappeared
altogether. Similar studies, pursuits, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
objects, induced an intimacy, which was never interrupted
but by the cold hand of death.</p>

<p>Something more is to be said of this personage.</p>

<p>Born of highly respectable connections, he was
educated at a public school, where his talents soon
inspired respect, and his facetiousness and wit, rendered
him exceedingly popular. This spirit never
forsook him through life, for he invariably continued
to animate the society of which he was a part, by incessant
sallies of cheerfulness, good humour, and the
very best sort of conversation. His talents, however,
were of a still higher order, and perhaps, there was
no situation within the scope of his ambition, which
he was not qualified to fill with dignity, and to the
public advantage. He was a sound and excellent
scholar, as the term is generally understood, but
he was, moreover, distinguished by very extensive
general knowledge and acquirements.</p>

<p>He several times claimed the public attention as
an author, and the characteristic features of whatever
he wrote, was strong sense, sound judgment,
and a perfect knowledge of his subject. These
solid and sober qualities proved an admirable check
upon the too great quickness, extreme vivacity, and
rapidity of conception, which distinguished his
friend, who, for a term of no very short continuance,
was also his coadjutor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>In the progress of a somewhat extended life, he
filled different stations, and he discharged the duties
of them all, with the most exemplary fidelity and
honour. Why was he not appointed to the exercise
of functions still more elevated and more dignified?
This is a question not very easy to be answered.
He might if he had thought proper. If he
had condescended to use the ordinary means, which
individuals similarly circumstanced, practise, and
generally with success, there was nothing in the
line of his profession too lofty for his pretensions,
and which the connections and friendships he had
formed, might not easily have procured. But
though not more proud than became a man so
endowed, and so distinguished, he had not the
flexibility, which in the present condition of society,
they who have good things for barter, invariably
require of those who want them. He scorned to
flatter and bow the knee to those, with whom he had
entered life on the level, and had continued to associate
with on the same terms of manly equality,
but whom better fortune, or greater address, not
superior merit, or stronger claims, had raised to
the height of worldly honours. Though not without
ambition, he had a sort of proud and manly
disregard of lucrative situations, merely considered
as such, and was not at all inclined to remit his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
ordinary habits, or to deviate from his accustomed
paths, in pursuit of them.</p>

<p>He did indeed attain, and by force of merit only,
the means of passing through life, with great respect
and honour, in possession of all its comforts,
and with not a few of its best advantages. These
he enjoyed to the fullest extent, participating in
them, with no very limited circle of old and long-tried
friends. What has been said of his claims
to worldly distinctions, is equally applicable to his
mental endowments. His learning and his talents
were equal to any undertaking. He would have
been a good historian, if he had directed his mind
to that branch of learning. A poet he was, and
in the epigrammatic part of poetry was excelled by
very few; he was well acquainted with the niceties
and subtleties of grammar, and of his own language
more particularly. He was by no means disputative,
but, if occasion required, was an expert controversial
writer. To finish all, he was a critic
of no ordinary precision and acuteness.</p>

<p>That he had faults, it is not pretended to deny;
but they inflicted no wounds. A sort of coldness
and reserve of manner was frequently considered
as the result of pride, and sometimes excited unfavourable
impressions; but it was not pride, and
very soon melted into familiarity. Among his intimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
friends it was impossible to be more communicative,
facetious, and agreeable. But it is time
to have done?</p>

<p>The above tribute is paid from a full and warm
heart. It is the result of long, very long attachment,
esteem, and gratitude; of a friendship
never interrupted; of an intercourse which a continued
series of years cemented. Can it be necessary
to say more?</p>

</div>

<p>The plane of the Sexagenarian’s literary horizon
became much extended, in consequence of this
connection, and much “<i>terra incognita</i>” was discovered
and explored. Several planets also in the
literary system, were by the aid communicated from
this source, contemplated with greater accuracy
and precision; the plains of the Muses were traversed
with congenial ardour, each deriving similar
gratification from the same sources. Much has
already been said, and indeed there seems hardly
any limit to what might be said, on the talents,
characters, performances, and fortunes, of their various
associates.</p>

<p>Memoranda of a great many personages still remain
more or less detailed in our manuscript; but
the work appears already extended beyond perhaps
the patience of many readers, and the task of selecting
and arranging from a crude mass, is not the
most satisfactory that can be imagined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>The Sexagenarian appears to have had from his
childhood a remarkable partiality for books of voyages
and travels, and sought after them with the
extremest eagerness, from the ingenious and imaginary
adventures of Robinson Crusoe, to those
more important works of authentic discovery, and
actual description, which have for the last century,
and indeed much before, obtained the sanction of
public approbation and esteem. This feeling naturally
led him to seek the personal acquaintance
of all those among his contemporaries, who had
made themselves eminent, either by their geographical
knowledge, or their actual visits to remote
regions and countries, less perfectly known.</p>

<p>Of many of these personages he has left notes,
which induce the disposition to believe, that he had,
at one time, entertained the intention of writing
something in a connected form, on the subject of
the value of their different observations and discoveries.
This, however, he did not do; but from
the remarks which he had made, the reader may
perhaps find some transient amusement in the
selection which succeeds.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Alexander Dalrymple.</span></h3>

<p>This was a very considerable man, perhaps few,
or none, of his contemporaries could compare with
him, either for the extent or the accuracy of his geographical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and nautical knowledge. His works on
these subjects were very numerous and very important,
and his original manuscripts, which, after his
death, were deposited in the archives of the Admiralty,
contain many valuable treasures.</p>

<p>It were to be wished, that as far as good policy
and the national interests would justify such a
measure, government would allow, under certain
restrictions, extracts to be made from these papers,
for the public information and satisfaction.</p>

<p>The English public have always been zealous
and generous encouragers of all undertakings,
which have had in view the increase of geographical
knowledge. There are no publications more secure
of success, than such as profess to detail the discoveries
of regions before unknown; which describe
the manners of those nations with whom we are less
perfectly acquainted, thus combining, at the same
time, information with improvement. Such propensities
merit, on the part of government, as far as
they can consistently make it, an adequate return.</p>

<p>Who could possibly be more proper for such an
official undertaking, than the gentleman who succeeded
Dalrymple in his situation of Hydrographer?
It would be exceedingly difficult to point out a
collection, without excepting even national repositories,
where so great a mass of books and tracts on
geography and navigation could be found, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
library of Mr. Dalrymple. They amounted to
many thousands, nor was there perhaps one, in
which he had not made some manuscript observation.
He had, moreover, the best and most popular
works of this kind, in every language.</p>

<p>His conversation was lively, interesting, and full
of information; he was obviously subject to great
irritability, which might partly be constitutional,
and partly perhaps induced by those severe fits of
the gout, to which he was subject.</p>

<p>In the decline of life, his personal appearance
was somewhat whimsical. Whenever he visited,
he carried with him a small stool, which appeared
indispensible to his comfort.</p>

<p>He was always ready and willing to communicate
what he knew, and it well answered the purposes
of those, who wanted information on the subjects
of the kingdoms and oceans of the world, to listen
with attention to Alexander Dalrymple.</p>

<p>The Sexagenarian appears to have been still
more familiarly acquainted with Dr. P. R.</p>

</div>

<p>Indeed the memorandums intimate, that not
the least interesting circumstance of his literary life
was implicated in his connection with this personage.
This Dr. R. had a brother, who, for a long
series of years had been resident in a remote
foreign country, where he successfully prosecuted
his profession. He became, from familiar communication
and personal observation, so well acquainted
with the natural history of the country,
the peculiarities of the climate, its endemic diseases,
the manners of the inhabitants, laws, usages, and
singularities, that he wrote and published an interesting
volume on the subject, which was very favourably
received, and extensively circulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Dr. P. succeeded to his brother in his professional
reputation, situation, and local advantages, and
exercising his mind on similar objects, with the
addition of still more favourable opportunities, he
very considerably added to the stores which his
brother had acquired, and became eminently qualified,
to reprint, with important alterations and
additions, the work which had obtained to his predecessor,
no insignificant degree of credit. He was
called upon to undertake this honourable office,
and he assented.</p>

<p>At this period, the Sexagenarian was a sort of
scholar of fortune, and not being immediately engaged,
as it should seem, in any work which exclusively
demanded his attention, did not disdain
the task of revising the manuscripts of authors, and
superintending their labours through the press.
For this employment, an adequate compensation
was expected and rendered.</p>

<p>The parties, in the present instance, had frequently
met, and were on certain terms of familiarity.
One evening, the Doctor took the writer
of these memoranda on one side, and proposed to
him to undertake the revision of his work in manuscript,
and the correction of it subsequently at the
press. This was readily agreed to, but no terms
were mentioned on either side.</p>

<p>The manuscript, which was of no ordinary bulk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
or extent, was received, examined with careful attention,
at the expence of no small portion of time,
and finally committed to the press.</p>

<p>It extended to no less than two large quarto
volumes, and probably altogether a year, or somewhat
more, was employed on the labour. In the
interval, our Sexagenarian and his family used to
speculate on the golden harvest about to be reaped,
by way of compensation. What was it to be?
a pipe of Madeira? a pair of silver candlesticks?
a gold repeater?</p>

<p>At length, the last sheet was sent to press, and
the day of publication announced. The corrector
waited upon the author to felicitate him on his safe
delivery. A week passed away—a fortnight—a
month—still no Madeira—no piece of plate;—in
short, no solid pudding, but a great deal of empty
praise. However it was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>And it was not always so. Similar occupations
were afterwards thrown in the way, but he had the
wisdom taught him by the experience he had obtained,
to undertake nothing but with certain specifications
of recompence.</p>

<p>This seems no improper opportunity of inserting
a detached anecdote on the subject of compensation
for literary labour, which occurs somewhere or
other in our manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>A venerable old clergyman, who had in part,
directed the education of our friend, and who took
a warm and friendly interest in his reputation and
welfare, had been informed, with no benevolent intention,
that he prostituted his learning and talents
to needy booksellers.</p>

<p>The Sexagenarian, on some occasion or other,
revisited the place where his friend and patron resided,
and both from affection and gratitude,
hastened to pay his respects, where they were so
justly due. He was greatly surprised to find the
warmth, with which he had hitherto, invariably, been
welcomed, changed into extreme coldness.</p>

<p>On requesting an explanation, Sir, said the old
gentleman, I am informed that you write for the
booksellers, than which I cannot conceive any thing
more degrading, or more unbecoming, a scholar and
a gentleman.</p>

<p>Pray Sir, did not Addison, and Swift, and
Pope, and before them Dryden, write for the booksellers?</p>

<p>Granted, but that was a very different matter:
their reputation was established, and they moreover,
obtained very large sums for their productions.</p>

<p>If, Sir, the largeness of the sum increases or diminishes,
as you appear to conceive it does, the
turpitude of the action, how much do you imagine
I received for my last work? I beg you also to remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
that I have a large and increasing family,
and nothing to depend upon but my talents and my
diligence.</p>

<p>Why perhaps fifty pounds.</p>

<p>I have received seven hundred guineas.</p>

<p>The old gentleman’s displeasure vanished in a
moment. I cannot blame you, I cannot blame you,
he exclaimed, and they parted as good friends as
ever.</p>

<p>Now to return to the brother author Doctor.
Bating this single circumstance of his being too
tenacious of his money, he was a most agreeable,
well-informed, and good-natured man. Though far
advanced in years, he retained a great deal of vivacity,
and has often enlivened a numerous circle
by his facetiousness and humour. No one endured
a jest with greater forbearance; and as he came
from a country where the Mahometan law prevailed,
and had written a detailed account of the usages
and peculiarities of the haram, he was often laughingly
reproached with availing himself of the privileges
of the Mahometan law to its fullest extent.
That he ranked as a bashaw of three tails, had
four wives, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Bruce appears to have been seen once, and
once only, by our Sexagenarian, who nevertheless
expresses, in various parts of his manuscript, a
general confidence in his veracity, and a great admiration
of his prowess and intrepidity. He lived
intimately with some of Bruce’s most familiar friends,
and had frequent opportunities of ascertaining that
many assertions made by the traveller, like those
of Herodotus, were confirmed by subsequent observation
and examination. But it was Bruce’s
peculiar character, that if he discerned, or ever
suspected any want of confidence in his auditors,
he disdained all explanation, and could not be prevailed
upon to enter upon any further discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>He was a very great friend, and frequent correspondent
of the individual mentioned in the pages
immediately preceding, who was able, from his
personal knowledge and local situation, to confirm
many things asserted by Bruce, which were at first,
in this country, thought equivocal. On his first
return from his remote and protracted travels, he
had some questions proposed to him on the subject
of the Bible in the language of Abyssinia, by a
venerable and highly distinguished member of our
Church, which he answered very satisfactorily.—He
afterwards voluntarily undertook to translate
literally, a number of proposed texts from the Pentateuch
of the Abyssinian Bible, in order that they
might be compared with the English version. He
did do this, but they were unfortunately mislaid
among his numerous papers. They, however, are
most probably in existence, and may hereafter appear.</p>

<p>A very ingenious clergyman, who was also well
versed in the Oriental languages, made a Catalogue
Raisonné of Bruce’s manuscript library, which of
itself would be very acceptable to the learned
world. The manuscripts, however, it is to be
hoped, will not be permitted to remain buried in
Scotland, but as they are of the greatest importance
to the elucidation of Scripture, will hereafter be
deposited in some of the public libraries of this
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>The following are some of these manuscripts:—</p>

<p>The Old Testament in five volumes, which do
not contain the Psalms, but have a copy of Ludolph’s
Æthiopic Psalter.</p>

<p>This was transcribed for Mr. Bruce at Gondar,
by scribes of the country, upon vellum. The character
is clear and beautiful, and there are marginal
variations. Many of the books begin and end with
a prayer, and as there was never before in Europe
a perfect copy of the Æthiopic Scriptures, means
should be taken to supply the Christian Church in
Africa with a complete copy of the Bible.</p>

<p>The fourth volume contains the book of Enoch.
There is moreover the New Testament in Æthiopic,
in two volumes, also upon vellum.</p>

<p>The first volume contains a preliminary discourse
upon the Gospels, and a Masoretic analysis of the
verses and paragraphs.</p>

<p>The Apostolic writings are also found in two volumes,
upon vellum. These four volumes, in all
probability, compose the only perfect copy of the
New Testament in Europe, written in the language
of Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Another volume contains the constitutions of the
Apostles. Another has the title of Synaxar, and is
an history of the Saints venerated in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The Arabic manuscripts are numerous and valuable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>The travels published by Bruce were greatly in
favour with the Sexagenarian, who has left various
annotations upon different passages, which they
contain. Though very partial, on the whole, to
this most extraordinary man, he was by no means
blind to his errors, or insensible of his inaccuracies.
His confidence in him was very materially diminished
latterly, from having discovered, that Bruce,
in all probability, never was at the battle of Sebraxos,
which he nevertheless describes with circumstantial
minuteness, and of which he has introduced
plans, drawn up with the precision of one well versed
in military tactics. There was also something remarkably
mysterious and suspicious, as our friend
seemed to think, in the circumstance and character
of Luigi Balugani, who accompanied Bruce as a
draughtsman. He owed more to his talents than
he was willing to acknowledge, and the story of
his death is glossed over in a very unsatisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>There is a long dissertation in our manuscript,
on Bruce’s theory of Solomon’s voyage to Ophir,
and perhaps it may be an object of regret, that it
is too long for insertion. The conclusions which
Bruce drew from his premises are not conceded,
nor does he appear to have had a very clear conception
of the subject on which he was writing, and
has failed altogether in proving that Sofola is Ophir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>To conclude this article, it appears, from the
concurring testimonies of succeeding travellers,
that Bruce was never appointed to the government
of Ras el Feel, nor indeed to any government at
all.</p>

<p>It may not, perhaps, be impertinent to subjoin,
that among Bruce’s manuscripts is a Coptic
manuscript on Papyrus.</p>

<p>It was found among the ruins of Thebes, in
Egypt. It is written in the Sahidic or Theban
dialect of the Coptic, that is of the language of
the Pharoahs. The above manuscript has been
described by Dr. Woide.</p>

<p>Whether the person next named in our
notes, properly comes under the head of celebrated
travellers, may, perhaps, be disputed; but every
one will allow, that as far as geographical knowledge
is connected with voyages and travellers, there are
few, if any, of modern times, to whom science is
more indebted, than to Major R.</p>

<p>Before his time, we of this country, hardly knew
any thing of the scientific construction of maps,
and some individuals here were termed geographers
to the King, who were totally ignorant of the principles
of their profession. The Major, however,
gave a notable example of what might be effected by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
personal observation, acting in conjunction with
real science. The obligations which his country
men owe him in this particular, cannot easily be
explained, but he may be considered as the father
of the English geographical school; and we now
accompany a traveller in all those parts of the
world, which he has undertaken to illustrate, with
confidence and security.</p>

<p>The map of the peninsula of India is beyond all
praise, and the elaborate dissertation by which it is
accompanied, is perhaps the most perfect thing of
the kind in our language.</p>

<p>How little did we know of Africa, till within the
last twenty years, and how imperfect were the best
geographical delineations of that region, not excepting
that of D’Anville! How little also should
we still have known even from the well-conducted,
expeditions of Hornemann, Brown, Park, and
others, if the same skilful hand had not assisted in
the illustration of their several journeys.</p>

<p>The great question of all, however, whether the
Niger has any communication with the Nile, still
remains undetermined; the learned subject of this
article is decidedly of opinion, that these rivers do
not meet.</p>

<p>Like many other personages of distinguished
merit and superior talents, the notes of our manuscript,
represent this eminent geographer, as of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
most placid and unassuming manners, communicating
his knowledge with a modest diffidence, and
listening to the suggestions, even of the less informed,
without the smallest degree of ill-humour.
The great work, however, by which his name will
go down to posterity, is perhaps his illustration of
the geography of Herodotus.</p>

<p>This too is announced in the Preface, to be only
the first division of a larger work, which was intended
to comprehend the whole of the ancient geography,
as improved by the Grecian conquests and
establishments, with such portions of military history,
as appear to want explanation.</p>

<p>None of this had appeared when the manuscript,
from which these extracts are made, was written.</p>

<p>The next character which presents itself in our
manuscript annotations, is that of a very eccentric
and whimsical Irish traveller. He also published
a book of travels in Spain and Portugal, by no
means uninteresting, or ill-written in itself, but
which was bought up and rendered scarce on account
of the great beauty of one of the plates, with
which it was embellished.</p>

<p>He was the son of a Dutch merchant, who retired
from Holland with a considerable fortune, to spend
the remainder of his days in this country, and with
this view, purchased property in one of our largest
provincial towns. This traveller was his eldest son,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
and every thing he undertook or did, his studies,
pursuits, habits, and acquaintance, were chosen
with the most extraordinary waywardness. His
characteristic principle was “<i>fari quid sentiat</i>,”
without any very nice regard to time, circumstance,
or persons. This was particularly obvious in all
he published, and in a neighbouring island, involved
him in no trifling perplexity or disgrace. By some
thoughtless expression, he offended the females of
the place which he visited, and they, to mark their
contempt and indignation, thought proper to call a
dishonourable utensil after his name, and had a
striking caricature of his person visible at bottom.</p>

<p>He published, however, one standard work, upon
chess, which will always be quoted with respect by
all who are engaged in this particular pursuit, the
varieties, chances, and labyrinths of which he well
describes, and which any indifferent reader may
peruse with satisfaction and amusement. What his
ultimate situation in life was, or whether he yet survived,
when these notes were written, was apparently
unknown to the Sexagenarian. All that appears
on this head is in the form of a query, thus:—Did
he not afterwards engage unsuccessfully in
business of a speculative kind, and lose the wreck
of his fortune?</p>

<p>The traveller had a brother of some waywardness
also, but who was very amiable, and, unlike the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
former, of the most unoffending manners. When
young, he had not a mere liking, but an absolute
passion for theatrical amusements. He in a manner
attached himself to the provincial company of the
place where he resided, accompanied them to whatever
place they went, never absented himself from
any of their performances, assisted them with
his countenance on all occasions, his advice, and
his purse.</p>

<p>This passion remained for a considerable number
of years without the smallest abatement, till he
finally formed a connection by marriage with a
family, the heads of whom were distinguished by
the very highest degrees of theatrical excellence,
and not more deservedly popular for their eminence
of this kind, than for their general accomplishments.
This gentleman also was an author, but
of a peculiar kind. His knowledge was indeed
principally confined to his own language, in the
literature of which, and more particularly in that
which related to the Drama, he was remarkably
well skilled. The performance which he produced
had relation to the greatest ornament of our country,
and which, if it was not entitled to the praise
of genius, might reasonably claim that of care and
diligence, of accuracy and usefulness.</p>

<p>A name next occurs, but little known in this
country, but in some degree implicated with the
character of an Englishman, who appears to have
obtained a celebrity, of which he was not altogether
deserving. The first person is Martin Sauer, the
latter, Joseph Billings.</p>

<p>Sauer accompanied Billings, as secretary, in an
expedition, undertaken by the command of the
Empress of Russia, to ascertain the latitude and
longitude of the mouth of the river Kovima, the
coast of the Tshutski, and of the islands in the
Eastern ocean, stretching to the American coast.
He came to this country, partly from commercial
views, and partly to publish himself, his own account
of this long and perilous voyage.</p>

<p>It was recommended to him, to obtain an introduction
to our Sexagenarian, as being a person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
likely to facilitate his views, with respect to his meditated
publication. He followed the advice, and
an acquaintance took place, the result of which,
gave rise to many curious notes and observations,
which have place in our manuscript.</p>

<p>Sauer’s narrative was published a great many
years since, and is very curious and interesting.
When he arrived with Billings at the Bay of St.
Lawrence, in the country of the Tshutski, they separated.
Billings proceeded over land with much
difficulty, and after escaping many dangers, till he
arrived at the Kovima, and Sauer returned by sea
to Kamtschatka.</p>

<p>It appears both from Sauer’s published narrative,
and from many private documents and communications,
that Billings was far from deserving the reputation
he obtained, and that he was by no means
qualified to undertake the superintendance of such
an expedition. He was remarkably ignorant, and
inflexibly obstinate. His ignorance, more than
once in the voyage, induced him to mistake one
place for another, and his obstinacy was the occasion
of his losing two new vessels, constructed for
his immediate use. A combination of both these
qualities prevented his accomplishing the great
object of his mission, which was to ascertain the
existence of a north-west passage. In this he
failed altogether. Billings, however, was a bold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
and hardy navigator, and though he did not accomplish
that which was expected of him, is entitled
to some share of respect. No notice has,
however, hitherto been taken of him in any English
book of biography.</p>

<p>Much favourable notice is made in our Memoranda
relating to Browne, the African traveller,
and many interesting conversations appear to have
taken place on the subject of what he had actually
observed, as well as of the expeditions which he
meditated. He had the enthusiasm of visiting remote
and less known regions so strong upon him,
that the wonder is, he should so long remain at
home after his return from Africa, however tedious,
perilous, and painful, his residence at Darfour must
necessarily have been.</p>

<p>No man, by his personal manners and appearance,
his gravity, firmness, good sense, and judgment,
appears to have been better qualified for undertakings
of the kind. His demeanour was precisely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
that of a Turk of the better order. He conversed
slowly and sparingly, never descended to
familiarity, observed each and all of the company
as if with jealousy and suspicion. But when this
wore off, and intimacy was established, he was exceedingly
communicative, and readily discussed the
subjects about which he was most anxious, and
best qualified, to impart information.</p>

<p>After much and long deliberation upon the subject,
he finally determined upon the expedition, in
the prosecution of which he lost his life. He
proceeded by Malta to Smyrna, and from thence
through Asia Minor, Amassya, Tokat and Armenia
to Tebriz. At this place he remained a few weeks,
expecting the arrival of the English Ambassador
from Hamadan, the ancient Ecbatana. He lived
with Sir G. O. some time at Tebriz, who gave him
letters to Naserraddin Mirza, son of Beg Ján, King
of Boccara, and to Ahmed Ali Mirza, the King of
Persia’s son, the governor of Khorasan, and residing
at Meshhed.</p>

<p>The Ambassador, moreover, procured him passports
and letters from the King of Persia and his
ministers, and a <i>Mehmander</i>, who would have been
responsible for his life and property, as far as the
Persian dominions extend. His impatience, however,
to proceed, induced him to leave the king’s
camp some hours before his Mehmander was ready,
and being in a Turkish dress, and not known to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
an Englishman, he was murdered by some wandering
tribe of Kurds or Turkomans, near the Kaflán
Kúh or Tiger Mountain, after having crossed the
river Kezel Ouzan, which separates Azerbarján
(Atropatera) from Irak.</p>

<p>He had no English attendant, but whilst he remained
in Persia, kept one groom and one valet,
both Persians, and had two or three horses.</p>

<p>He left no papers or memoranda behind him
when he departed from Tebriz, but a few dispersed
fragments were collected at the spot where the
body was found.</p>

<p>He often avowed his intention of publishing his
travels to Bokhara and Samarkand, and he purposed,
had it been practicable, to return by the northern
end of the Caspian sea, as he was to have gone by
the southern end of it. The Ambassador made such
representations to the King of Persia, that both he
and his son Abbas Mirza took the greatest pains to
discover the assassins.</p>

<p>Mr. B. was in appearance and indeed in fact, one
of the most reserved men in the world—cold, cautious,
and wary; and yet, in this last journey, he
was so impatient to proceed, that he not only refused
to wait for the escort, which the Ambassador
undertook to provide for him, but he made a display
of the gold which was to enable him to accomplish
his purpose.</p>

<p>This last fact, though strongly asserted, is so incompatible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
with his general habits and character,
that it may well excite a suspicion of its accuracy.
True it certainly is, that the same morning brought
to England the news of his safe arrival at Tabriz,
on his way to Kurdistan, and of his being murdered
by the very band, who undertook to be his guides
and protectors.</p>

<p>The intelligence of his death came to England
through Somnerat, the celebrated French traveller.
It is, however, to be hoped, that as some of his
papers remain in private hands, the public will
have, sooner or later, the benefit of his observations,
as far as he was actually able to proceed.</p>

<p>The annotations relating to Browne, in our manuscript,
conclude with a paragraph, in which serious
regret is expressed, at his scepticism with respect
to religious subjects. Indeed he appears to have
been an avowed disciple of the school of Volney,
and the other miscreant writers of that stamp.</p>

<p>He has deformed and defaced his otherwise valuable
publications, with some passages so bad as not
to be transcribed, and some remarks which he has
inserted on education, prove that he had adopted
many of the wildest absurdities of the modern
French philosophy.</p>

<p>The following particulars concerning the latter
part of the life of Browne, are added by him who
revised and has superintended the publication of
these volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>His intention, as above stated, was to proceed from
Tebriz to Khorasan, to the governor of which place
he had the strongest recommendations from the
English ambassador, then resident at Tebriz with the
Persian monarch. This of itself being a distance of
nearly a thousand miles, through a barbarous country,
was an adventure sufficiently arduous to have
deterred any other individual, of a less persevering
and determined character. From Khorasan he
purposed nevertheless to make his way to Samarcand,
and thence to Turkistan, an undertaking
which even to the best informed among the natives,
appeared to be full of difficulty, as well as danger.</p>

<p>Sir Gore Ouseley, with the greatest kindness
and promptitude, undertook to procure him the
protection of a Mahmendar, an officer of the King,
under whose escort, as far as Chorasan, he not only
would have had personal security, but horses and
provisions every where at his command, at the expence
of the Persian government.</p>

<p>There was, however, some little delay in the
equipment of this officer appointed to attend him,
occasioned partly by the tardiness of the man
himself, and partly by the negociation then near
a conclusion between the courts of Russia and
Persia, which necessarily occupied a considerable
portion of the ambassador’s time.</p>

<p>Browne accordingly became impatient, and left
Tebriz with two attendants only, directing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Mahmendar to follow him. This officer having received
his instructions, and apprehensive of the English
Ambassador’s resentment, lost no time in his
endeavour to overtake the traveller. Most unfortunately
he found him within forty miles of the
Persian Monarch’s camp, barbarously murdered.
Plunder does not appear to have been the object,
as Mr. Browne’s papers, pistols, and effects, were
recovered, and placed in the hands of Sir Gore
Ouseley. His money, of which he had not a great
deal, was certainly seized by his servant. But in
all probability, he owed his death not so much to
any improper display of his property, as to his invincible
obstinacy with which he resisted all expostulation
and remonstrance, in always wearing the
Turkish dress. Now it happens that the Hordes,
by some of whom Browne was murdered, entertain
the most deadly hatred and animosity against the
Turks, for one of whom in all probability he was
mistaken.</p>

<p>Strict search was, however, made after his assassins,
and a great number of the inhabitants of the
district, where he died, were apprehended, upon
whom the King of Persia, without any judicial proceeding,
expressed to the ambassador his determination
of inflicting the summary punishment of
death. This, however, Sir Gore O. would not
permit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>The surmise that he owed his death to the circumstance
of his appearing as a Turk, is somewhat
confirmed by the fact, that within a few months
preceding this melancholy event, Sir William
Ouseley, brother to the ambassador, and who accompanied
him in his mission, passed this very spot
without molestation.</p>

<p>It is a subject of the deepest regret, and a most
serious loss to literature, that Browne did not live
to fulfil the object of his expedition. How well
qualified he was to increase our stores of geographical
information, his work on Africa sufficiently
attested. Of the countries which he meditated to
visit, with the view of describing, our information
is very scanty as well as unsatisfactory. These
were more particularly the regions of Chorasan,
Boccara, Samarcand, &amp;c. concerning which regions,
our best books of geography communicate very
little.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Further particulars from another hand.</i>)</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been said above,
and the seeming attention and assistance paid to
the English Ambassador’s endeavours to discover
and punish Brown’s assassins, there is too much
reason to apprehend that he fell a victim to the
jealousy of the Persian government. People in
those remote countries, and the Mahometans more
particularly, have no conception whatever of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
person’s undertaking the perils and fatigues of a
long and distant journey, for the sake of intellectual
or scientific improvement only. They invariably
attach jealousy and suspicion to such a character
wherever he appears, and impute to him, either
political motives, or the desire of gain. The regions
to which Browne directed his attention, were at the
time in a very unquiet and unsettled state. The
Persian Sovereign considered his authority over
them, as precarious and insecure. The peace with
Russia was not definitively concluded, and the
government might, not improbably, entertain a suspicion,
that Browne’s motive was political, and not
the avowed one of curiosity alone. Several subsequent
incidents, circumstantially considered, very
much tend to corroborate the idea, that the Persian
ministers were not entirely innocent of the death
of this unfortunate traveller.</p>

<p>In the first place, his arms were not touched;
his gun, double-barrelled pistols, and weapons were
all preserved and carefully returned to the English
Ambassador. So also were his papers of every
kind, and indeed each article of his property, except
his money, which it was generally understood was
seized by his servant and secretary.</p>

<p>In the next place, one of our artillery-men, who
was stationed at Ispahan, on some provocation he
had received, neglect of pay, personal affront, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
some other cause of offence, abruptly left the place,
and undismayed by the danger and the distance, endeavoured
to make his way to Tebriz, where the
Ambassador was then resident, in the court of the
Persian Monarch. He then proceeded in spite of
every obstacle, nearly to the spot where Browne
was murdered, when he was stopped, as it should
seem, by some of the miscreants, who had imbrued
their hands in the blood of his countryman. They
insisted upon his immediate return, which for a long
time he refused to do, till at length they told him
that if he did not, they would treat him as they did
the Englishman the other day.</p>

<p>Browne, when at Tebriz, had lived at the house
of Colonel D⸺, who commanded the artillery
sent to Persia from this country. This gentleman
was greatly affected at the news of Browne’s death,
and determined, if possible, to obtain his remains
for burial. He accordingly availed himself of the
influence he possessed, and obtained from the Persian
ministers, the necessary mandate, that Browne’s
remains should be delivered to the Colonel’s messengers.</p>

<p>He employed for this purpose a trusty serjeant,
who proceeded to the spot. On producing the
minister’s orders to the principal person of the
place, he was informed that the mandate was so
peremptory, that it could not be resisted, but at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
the risk of his head, and he would immediately
give the necessary directions for the bones to be
collected. Much evasion was nevertheless practised,
and so much time lost, that the honest serjeant
became impatient, and declared that if what he
came for was not immediately produced, he would
return without them. At this moment, two men, with
each a small burden, were seen approaching, who
were declared to have with them what was wanted.</p>

<p>They were delivered to the serjeant, who, as
directed, rewarded the parties, and hastened to return.
The English gentlemen had intended to
come out in a body to meet the relics, had ordered
a coffin covered with black velvet to receive them,
and intended to inter them with the usual ceremonies
of the church. But the serjeant had already
returned, and deposited the charge in the officer’s
house. The surgeon of the British establishment
undertook to examine the bones, and arrange them,
but on closer inspection it appeared that a gross
imposition had been practised. There was indeed
a part of a skull, but the other bones were certainly
not human, but belonged to some animal.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, information has been
received, that a gentleman, an intimate connection
of the traveller, has obtained possession of his
papers, and of various documents relating to him
and his meditated journies. These are methodizing
and preparing for the press.</p>

</div>

<p>From Browne let us proceed to the character
next in succession, who had not his imperfections,
and with whom the Sexagenarian appears to have
had much and familiar intercourse. This was the
Ambassador from the East India Company to the
court of Ava, during the government of Sir John
Shore, afterwards Lord Teignmouth. Before this
mission, our geographical knowledge of Ava, and
the contiguous countries, was exceedingly imperfect
and inaccurate. The few books which had
been published on the subject, were principally
French, and were confined to unsatisfactory descriptions
of Siam and Pegu; whereas the empire
of Ava comprehends both Siam and Pegu, which
are subordinate and tributary to the court of Ummo-rapoora,
or, as it is there denominated, “The
Golden Foot.” It extends to Tibet and China on
the north, and on the south to Junkseylon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>Geographical perplexities were, however, cleared
up, and errors, particularly with regard to the
Great River Irrawaddy, removed by this expedition
of M.S. For example, the river which connects
Pegu with the ocean, was by former geographers
continued from beyond Pegu, to the frontiers of
China; whereas the main river, the mouth of which
is Rangoon, passes through Prome to the capital,
and to the borders of China. The Pegu river is
relatively an unimportant stream, taking its rise a
very little way above Pegu.</p>

<p>By the assistance of Major Rennell and Mr.
Dalrymple, the geography of Ava has now received
great illustration; and jealous as that nation still
continues to be, with respect to the admission of
Europeans among them, political necessities, as
well as the expediency of commercial interchange,
will probably, in the progress of a few years, remove
whatever obscurities may yet remain.</p>

<p>With respect to the people themselves, of their
manners and customs, the productions of their soil,
their religion, and their learning, the European
world was almost in entire ignorance. With the
exception of a small volume, translated from the
French, and entitled “A Relation of the Voyage
to Siam, performed by Six Jesuits, sent by the
French King to the Indies and China in 1685,”
there was no book in the English language illustrative
of the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>No person was, in the opinion of the Sexagenarian,
who has so expressed himself in our notes,
better qualified in all respects for such an expedition
than Major S—s. He combined the firmness
of the soldier with the courteous manners of the
gentleman, and he found the union of these qualities,
of no small importance in the progress of his
undertaking. He accordingly succeeded to the
full extent of his views, and to the entire satisfaction
of his employers. This latter circumstance is
sufficiently attested by his being dispatched a second
time to the same place, to explain some misconceptions
which had taken place on the part of the
Ava government. Of this second expedition, however,
no public notice has been taken, nor did the
traveller avail himself of the opportunity thus
offered, to correct or enlarge what he had before
written and published on the subject.</p>

<p>It is rather remarkable, that so very little should
have been previously known of an empire, second
only in extent to that of China. The Sovereign
considers himself as the greatest Potentate upon
earth, and indeed nothing can be more ostentatiously
splendid than the grandeur of his court.</p>

<p>The East India Company thought so highly of
the services rendered them by their agent, that
they voted him a donation of twelve thousand
Sicca rupees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>On his return to his native country, his active
spirit found various opportunities of employment.
He obtained a seat in Parliament, he was confidentially
employed in some important offices by
government, and having retained his situation in
the army, refused to resign it, when he might,
without the smallest imputation on his honour, or
his courage, have retired. He accordingly joined
his regiment in the Peninsula, and distinguished
himself as well by his personal exertions, as by testimonies
of diplomatic skill and acuteness.</p>

<p>But his constitution had long been shaken; he
had never entirely recovered his wonted energy,
after his second expedition to the court of Ava.
He was engaged in the unfortunate expedition of
Sir John Moore, and though he survived the battle
of Corunna, and got safe back to England, he died
very shortly afterwards, really exhausted by debility
and fatigue. He certainly was one of those
personages, of whom some memorial should be
preserved, and as none have preceded the present,
imperfect and inadequate as this may be, it will be
far, it is hoped, from rendering him dishonour.</p>

<p>With no less degree of familiarity, and with an
equal portion of esteem, is represented the name
and character of the Ambassador from the East
India Company, to the court of the Teesho Lama,
in Tibet. Materials for biographical sketches,
are in general easily collected, and when used with
skill, importantly contribute both to information
and amusement. But it rarely happens, that the
writer or compiler of such sketches has the advantage
which our Sexagenarian possessed, of a personal
intimacy with so many individuals, of such
various talents, pursuits, and employments.</p>

<p>With this last traveller the intercourse appears
to have been frequent and familiar, and it should
seem that he had been consulted on the subject of
one of the most curious and interesting works in
our language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>What had been vaguely and imperfectly represented
of Bootan, Tibet, and its Lama, had, till
this work appeared, rather the character of Oriental
fiction, than of grave, sober, and accurate
narrative. Fiction itself, indeed, can hardly proceed
further than is exemplified in the Tibetian
idea of their Lama, who though he never ceases
to exist, withdraws himself from the world, when
the body, which he has vouchsafed to inhabit, decays
from age or disease, and at a proper interval,
again makes his appearance, by animating an
infant; his presence in whom is unequivocally
ascertained by certain well-known and characteristic
symbols.</p>

<p>Few more important volumes than this communication
on the subject of Tibet, have appeared in
modern times, and our Sexagenarian has not failed
to express himself with particular self-complacency
from the circumstance of having rendered some
service in its publication.</p>

<p>It is not on every occasion that due sagacity
and wisdom is exercised in selecting agents for
remote political missions, but as in the former
instance of the Ambassador to Ava, so in this
of the deputation to Bootan and Tibet, the East
India Company could not possibly have decided
with greater propriety, or with sounder wisdom.</p>

<p>The people of Ava were a lofty, ostentatious, and
courtly race. The Ambassador to that region had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
a proper sense of his own dignity, and of that of the
nation of which he was the representative, and at
the same time entered into all the splendid gaieties
of a gaudy court, without rendering any violence to
his natural disposition.</p>

<p>The Tibetians were grave, formal, and reserved;
marked by the strongest peculiarities of manners,
and of prejudices. The agent sent among them,
was grave, serious, sensible, properly tenacious of
his personal importance, without offending peculiarities,
the extreme simplicity and eccentricity of
which, cannot, under a less sanction than that of
the Ambassador’s assertion of what he witnessed,
easily obtain credit. What to a European, and
more particularly to an Englishman can be more
preposterous, than the Polyandry of Tibet, and to
see “one female associating her fate and fortune
with all the brothers of a family, without any restriction
of age or of numbers.” Marriage, it is
observed by our Traveller, is in Tibet, considered as
an odium, an heavy burden, the weight and obloquy
of which, a whole family are disposed to lessen,
by sharing it among them. Indeed the number of
husbands to one female, is not defined nor restricted
within any limits. Mr T. mentions one family in
which five brothers were living very happily together
with one female, under the same connubial
compact.</p>

<p>The termination of this valuable traveller’s life was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
extremely melancholy. His health had long been
impaired by climate, as well as by his fatiguing
exertions in the discharge of his functions. In his
progress one day from his apartments in the West
end of the town to the city, he was attacked in
Fleet-street with an epileptic fit, and as no papers
were found on his person, to designate precisely
who he was, he was carried to the poor-house to be
owned. It is more than probable, that under these
circumstances, he did not receive all the attention,
which his real rank in life claimed, and his immediate
situation demanded; but in this place he
was not recognized till he was actually dead. His
publication will, however, always rank exceedingly
high in the class to which it belongs, and the memory
of his accomplishments, and of his amiable
and conciliatory manners, can cease only with the
lives of those who enjoyed the advantages of his
friendship.</p>

<p>The last traveller to distant regions, of whom
there are notices in our Sexagenarian’s Recollections,
was a noble Lord, the history of whose life
involves many extraordinary particulars. The
gay, the witty, but depraved Lord ⸺, was
his uncle, and he has often been heard to detail
the very mysterious circumstances of the death of
his relation, with much solemnity and pathos. He
was at that time at school, his morals therefore
were not contaminated by his connection with that
nobleman, though it cannot be denied that he afterwards
launched into the gaieties of youth, and the
dissipation of the times, with an ardour to which,
unfortunately, his rank and situation afforded too
many and too great facilities.</p>

<p>Disappointed and injured in the domestic establishment
he had formed, he had, moreover, to contend
with the most cruel and abominable aspersions
aimed at the very vitality of his character. These
however, from the cause which excited them, as
well as from the source from which they were circulated,
were, by all those who were qualified to
ascertain the facts with precision, discovered ultimately
to be the result of calumny and malice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
The late Lord Kenyon, as good a judge of evidence
as the most experienced lawyer could possibly
be, avowed this opinion forcibly and solemnly
from the bench.</p>

<p>In the extreme perturbation of mind and spirits,
naturally produced by such circumstances,
the noble Lord very judiciously determined to
make the experiment, how far change of scene, and
the exploring of remote regions, might tend to restore
him to the tranquillity he had lost. At this
period he obtained an introduction to the Marquis
W⸺, who filled the high office of Governor
General of India with great dignity and splendour.
To his hospitality he accordingly resolved to resort,
and he afterwards lived with the Marquis on terms
of friendship.</p>

<p>He proceeded to India, where he enjoyed every
facility which authority could bestow, or curiosity
require. He first visited Calcutta, on the Bay of
Bengal; he then went up to Lucknow, where he
spent a month. He then returned down the
Ganges to Calcutta, sailed to Ceylon, thence coasted
the W. of Ceylon and the eastern shore of the
Peninsula to Madras. He afterwards crossed
through the Mysore to Mangalore, sailed to the
Red Sea, and again returning to Bombay, proceeded
to the Red Sea a second time.</p>

<p>His Lordship had intended to have visited Agra,
but he was prevented by the war with the Mahrattas.
Whilst at Bombay, however, he visited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
Poonah, the capital of the Mahratta country, and
such other places as were deserving the investigation
of an enlightened traveller.</p>

<p>From Bombay he crossed the Indian ocean, and
arrived at Mocha, in the Red Sea. After a certain
sojourn at that place, he proceeded to Massouah,
the key by which means, Bruce was enabled
to penetrate to Abyssinia. From Massouah,
Mr. Salt, Lord ⸺’s Secretary, was dispatched
to visit the Ras at Antalow. Mr. Salt
having successfully accomplished this expedition,
joined his illustrious friend at Massouah, and after
various perils and difficulties, they arrived in safety
at Suez. The rout from Suez was that usually
pursued by travellers from the East, namely, to
Cairo, Alexandria, Malta, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The details published of these interesting travels,
were not, however, so popular as might reasonably
have been expected, and as they actually deserved.
They certainly contained a great deal of original
matter, and a large mass of important information.
They were more favorably received on the continent.
The translator of them into French has,
in his introduction, drawn a strong contrast between
the reception Lord ⸺ met with in his
native country, and what would have been given
in France to a man of his Lordship’s situation in
life, who would have performed such a work.
Bonaparte considered it so important as to the State
of India, that Notes were ordered to be inserted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
by the Police, as an antidote, which was done;
the original order is in his Lordship’s possession,
and it is curious that Lord V. has often been the subject
of Napoleon’s conversation with Englishmen.</p>

<p>They were considered by the very learned Editor
of the voyage of Nearchus, as entitled to
the merit of having elucidated many abstruse and
complicated points in ancient geography, and in
many parts as fairly claiming the honour of actual
discovery. Certain it is, that no modern navigator
has before taken an actual survey of that
part of the African coast, from the straits of Babulmandeb
to the 26th degree N. &amp;c. Perhaps the
principal cause which restrained their more extensive
circulation, is to be found in the first volume,
where too great importance has been given to trifles,
and the work too much swelled out with circumstantial
representations of Oriental ceremonies,
visits, dresses, and presents, which scholars contemn,
and which in fact had not the charm of novelty
to recommend them.</p>

<p>The work was afterwards published in a smaller
compass, pruned of many of these eccentricities and
unnecessary appendages, and can never, in its
present form, be perused without much gratification
and improvement.</p>

<p>Upon this work and its author, the following
remarks subsequently occur in our manuscript,
and are evidently written in another hand, but they
well deserve preservation, as well from their erudition
as their sagacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>Indiscriminate praise is of no value, but the
sense of this noble Lord’s merits as a traveller,
arises from the consideration of his engaging in
such a service, at a time of life when young men
of rank, think of little but their pleasures. It
arises, moreover, from his attention to the manners
of the nations which he visited, and from the judgment
of the plan, which he executed with so much
ardour and perseverance.</p>

<p>The survey of the western coast of the Red Sea,
was a grand desideratum in geography, where nothing
essential had been done since the voyage of
De Castro. It is not a speculation of curiosity, but
a duty incumbent upon a nation, possessed of the
greatest maritime power that ever existed, to explore
every region, where the sea is navigable, and
this not only in a commercial view, but for the extension
of science.</p>

<p>Lord ⸺’s coarse from the straits of Babulmandeb,
up to Salaka, is a survey, not only of importance
to navigation and science, but of great
utility in shewing that there are means of approaching
the most barbarous inhabitants of the coast.</p>

<p>Many of the observations which are introduced
upon the coast, above and upon the country of Adel,
are the best illustrations possible in regard to ancient
geography. They must have been peculiarly
gratifying to the very learned Dr. Vincent, as they
coincide with the nature, both of the natives and
the countries which his pen had delineated from
ancient authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>The trade and caravans of Adel, the intercourse
of that country with Arabia and Adooli, the western
entrance of the Straits, the Opsian Bay, the
Bay of Adooli, the regal government of Axuma,
the double sovereignty of Suakin, the independent
Bedoweens, above the Tahama, or Tessiborike,
the site of Berenice, in Foul Bay, the existence of
the gold mines, and the evidence of gold, still obtainable
on the coast, all prove, whatever may have
been the revolution of governments, or the changes
effected by the lapse of time, that the general features
are still indelible, and the portrait true.</p>

<p>The bay to which the noble traveller has given
the fantastic appellation of “Botherem Bay,” with
all its intricacies, shoals, and islands, will be found
perfectly consistent with both Agatharchides and
Diodorus.</p>

<p>The Axumite inscription proves incontestibly the
prevalence of the Greek language in Abyssinia.
The fact undoubtedly was, that as soon as Adooli
became a mart, approachable by the Greeks from
Egypt, Greeks established themselves there as residents.
Thus they had formerly done all around
the Euxine, from the time of Herodotus, to the
time when it was visited by Arrian, in the reign
of Adrian.</p>

<p>Greeks of this sort were not only merchants, but
became ministers, or agents for the native Sovereigns,
such as Xenophon found in the time of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
Scuthes, and by such a Greek, the inscription
was doubtless drawn up for Aeizaneus.</p>

<p>The whole work does the writer great credit. The
style is unaffected; and the commercial speculations,
in regard to Arabia and Abyssinia, of greater
public importance, than they hitherto appear to
have been considered.</p>

<p>Our Memoirs are now drawing towards their
close, for although numerous recollections yet remain,
they are rather of a miscellaneous and desultory
kind, consisting more of detached remarks
and local anecdotes, than of any regular and consistent
narrative. Such parts of these shall be
selected and introduced, as appear best calculated
to excite interest, or promote entertainment.</p>

<p>To whom the following “Recollection” can
apply, the editor has not the remotest conception,
but that the portrait was drawn from nature, is
evinced by the strength of the outline, the force of
the colouring, and the general appearance as a
whole.</p>

<p>A Christian Bishop!—Much veneration has in
various parts of these Recollections been expressed
for individuals filling this high and important office,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
expressed too with an honest warmth, resulting
from a near contemplation, and personal experience
of their virtues. What ought the characteristics
of a Christian Bishop to be? Firmness—learning—charity—general
benevolence—meekness—disposition
to forgive injuries—spirit of reconciliation—a
love of peace, and desire to ensue it.</p>

<p>Great and amiable qualities truly! Yet a Bishop
did once present himself in the progress of a literary
life, who had not quite all these peculiarly
honourable distinctions. Firmness he had, if that
term can in justice be applied to him, who is
<i>tenax propositi</i>—right or wrong. The distinction
of learning must be allowed him, without any qualification
of any kind. As to the rest—charity—general
benevolence—meekness—disposition to forgive
injuries—spirit of reconciliation—love of
peace—desire to ensue it—a little reflection is necessary
before the claim to these qualities can be
conceded.</p>

<p>Is it a proof of charity, or benevolence, or meekness,
to provoke a large body of united individuals
by anonymous insinuations and attacks, which there
was a compulsory obligation subsequently to retract
and disavow?</p>

<p>By which of the apostles or evangelists are
maxims of persecution inculcated? To admonish
and advise, is certainly part of the episcopal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span> function,
and as the very name denotes, to exercise a
becoming vigilance with respect to those who are
comprehended in their flock. But suppose an
honest, industrious individual, proceeding in the
line of his professional duty, which he has invariably
found to lead successfully to the object desired,
and suppose he declines from conscientious
motives, or from pride, or obstinacy, if you please,
to deviate from this line, or path, at the haughty
suggestion of a superior, be he Dean, or even a
Bishop, is he to be persecuted, harassed, exasperated
with unrelenting malignity?</p>

<p>Lastly, supposing a professional brother, at the
time, of equal pretensions in rank, situation, connections,
and accomplishments, from whom attention
and kindness had been previously received,
and through whom, and in concert with whom, a
work of high importance to religion, morals, and
learning, had been prosecuted, should, in a thoughtless
moment, by a mere casual and inadvertent
expression, give cause of offence? Is such a trespass
not only never to be forgotten or forgiven, but
is it compatible with those qualities, which ought to
characterize a Christian minister, whatever be his
station, to retain a sense of the transgression, implacable,
and eternal; and forgetful of former
reciprocated kindness, to treat the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>offender as one
deserving to be deprived of “fire and water?”</p>

<p>Fye on such Christian ministers, bishops, or
what not!!</p>

</div>

<p>Before the subject of Prelates and Prelacy
is definitively concluded, it may be as well to insert
one anecdote from the manuscript, which stands
alone and unconnected, but which the Sexagenarian
states he had from authority not to be disputed.</p>

<p>It happened during the ministry of Pitt, that a
vacant bishoprick was kept for a long time in abeyance.
Among the expectants (for we must not say
candidates) was one whose immoderate anxiety and
eagerness on the subject, was really ridiculous; (the
word in the manuscript was <i>contemptible</i>, but this
had been erased.)</p>

<p>He used to write or send two or three times a
day, to the Premier’s Secretary, to learn whether
any decision was yet made, and in one of these
<i>grandes epistolæ</i>, he ingenuously confessed that his
solicitude on the subject was so great, that it really
deprived him of sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>It will hardly excite surprize to learn that the
above gentleman was not distinguished by greatness
of mind, and that he was rather to be classed among
the <i>fruges consumere nati</i>, than among the <i>egregia
semper patriæ capita</i>.</p>

<p>The story is on record of the new married Lady
Burlington, who when she saw Swift for the first
time, fancied from his dress and appearance, that
he was, to use the Dean’s own words, “some hedge
alehouse parson,” and accordingly resented his familiarity
of address, as presumptuous and insolent.
He had asked her to sing, but instead of complying,
she left the room in disgust, and in tears. When,
however, she next saw him, she approached him
with a graceful air and curtsey, and said “I will
sing to you Mr. Dean whenever you please.”
Something not remarkably dissimilar, happened
between the great man above alluded to, and our
Sexagenarian.</p>

<p>He had an appointment with a much greater man
than either of them, and was shewn into the private
apartment of the person who had sent for him, and
here, by accident, he saw the anxious expectant for
the mitre, waiting also for an interview. The personal
appearance of our friend was not remarkably
prepossessing, and he did not much sacrifice to the
graces in his dress; so that his attempts to enter
into conversation were resisted, and great talents
for silence were exhibited on both sides, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
space of half an hour.</p>

<p>At length the great man entered, who, as luck
would have it, first accosted the Sexagenarian, and
with particular cordiality. The consequence was
electrical. The Doctor’s austerity of countenance
in a moment relaxed into the most complacent
good humour. He was really much concerned,
not to have known who the gentleman was, with
whom he had been sitting. He should be proud
to rank him among his acquaintance, was not
ignorant of his reputation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>That conjecture may not be directed to the wrong
object, let it be understood, that this person, though
subsequently elevated to the Episcopal dignity, was
not Bishop A. or B. or C. or D. &amp;c.</p>

<p>About Bishop H. there are a few scattered memoranda
in the manuscript, but though the Sexagenarian
had occasionally met him, no acquaintance
subsisted between them, and though he most
highly, on all occasions, venerated his learning and
talents, and gave public testimony that he did so,

<p>In a far, far different spirit are written, in several
portions of the manuscript, certain notices of a very
Reverend Dean, concerning whom there appears to
have been the intention of composing something
more in detail. How much and how greatly he was
revered by the writer, appears from the following
quotation, with which the Recollections on this
subject are introduced.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Tu comes Phœbo, comes ibis astris.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This venerable personage ought, with propriety,
to have been introduced in an earlier period of the
work; he has indeed been casually mentioned, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
his talents and accomplishments were of so high
and superior a character, that it looks a little inconsistent
with the profound respect which he evidently
inspired, not to have solicited attention to him
before.</p>

<p>He was one of the soundest scholars in Europe,
certainly to be classed among the most skilful and
accomplished geographers, an admirable critic,
and in every character, and every relation of life,
entitled to the most exalted encomium.</p>

<p>With all these claims to esteem and love, he was
of the greatest simplicity of manners, unaffected,
unassuming, powerful in argument, but not like
Johnson, overbearing; an excellent divine, steady
patriot, and unalterable friend.</p>

<p>His works will endure with the language in which
they were written, and in other languages also;
his geographical researches, having necessarily attracted
the attention of those engaged in similar
pursuits, in all parts of civilized Europe. He seems
to have had one talent in common with Herodotus,
that with respect to places hitherto partially
known, and imperfectly explored, further investigation
generally proved his conjectures to have
been founded on the most substantial grounds, and
his conclusions true. This is more particularly
the fact, with respect to the Periplus of the Erythræan
Sea, and the examination of the strange hypothesis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
of Bryant, relating to the plain of Troy.</p>

<p>By the way, the name of Jacob Bryant occurs
occasionally in our Sexagenarian’s Recollections.
It is stated that he once or twice encountered him
in literary societies. But he represents Bryant,
allowing him at the same time all that his warmest
advocates can require, as being very tenacious of
his opinions, and impatient of contradiction. Any
opposition to his affirmations, however candidly or
temperately expressed, he was apt to consider as a
declaration of hostility; and on one in which the
amiable personage was concerned, who forms the
immediate subject of this article, he degraded himself
so far as to use the coarsest terms of invective;
nay, he even called his learned opponent <span class="smcap">assassin</span>.</p>

<p>Mark, reader, the contrast of the two characters.
The person thus vilely, as well as falsely stigmatized,
merely in reply expressed “surprize to find that a
man of letters, of integrity, of talents, of refined
manners, of an understanding cultivated by all
the studies, classical and religious, which tend to
soften asperity of mind, and severity of judgment,
should so far transgress the law of controversy,
as to style his adversary an assassin, because upon
a question of literature, he dared to be of a different
opinion, and to assign some reasons for that
difference.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>That Bryant was vindictive whenever his literary
reputation was impugned, appears also from
the following circumstance. He knew the Sexagenarian
to be concerned in a publication, in which
some of his assertions and dogmas had been dispassionately
discussed, and though he met him
at the house of a common friend, who equally
respected both parties, he declined entering into
conversation.</p>

<p>But to return to our first subject, the venerable
Dean. Various are the branches of science which
his pen illustrated and adorned; indeed all his
publications may be considered as truly valuable,
and highly important. The intricacies of the
Greek verb, peculiarities relating to the military
tactics of the ancients, many arduous and obscure
points, both in ancient and modern geography, a
most powerful and effective vindication of the system
of national education, with various other contingent
appendages to learning, have been elucidated
by his learning, and embellished by his taste.</p>

<p>The question may naturally be asked why, with
such an accumulation of claims, did he not ascend
to the highest gradation of his profession? The
interrogatory is more easily proposed than answered.
Perhaps it is true, that with all his great
attainments, and love of literature, the Prime
Minister of that day was so occupied with political
perplexities and difficulties, that he considered the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
pursuits of the Muses, as trifling and subordinate,
and conferred distinction and reward on those only
and their connections, and adherents, who were
most useful and necessary to him in the prosecution
of his views.</p>

<p>However, the honours which were bestowed,
were communicated in the handsomest manner possible,
and if inadequate to the merits of the receiver,
there is great reason to presume that they satisfied
his utmost ambition.</p>

<p>We are again carried back to a remoter period;
but these inequalities, with respect to chronology,
merely serve to confirm the opinion long since
given, that had life been spared, and opportunity
allowed, the Sexagenarian meditated a compact
and regular whole.</p>

<p>In the part of the manuscript at which we are
now arrived, are many observations and anecdotes
of an eccentric, but well-known character, of considerable
reputation for science in his day, an excellent
antiquary, a polite scholar, and accomplished
gentleman.</p>

<p>Such was E. K⸺, of M⸺ S⸺.
His taste was acute, refined, and multifarious, his
knowledge great and extensive, and on certain
subjects profound. He possessed some of the
finest bronzes in the world, a few exceedingly valuable
pictures, beautiful specimens of Oriental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
curiosities, and more particularly of rare and old
china, and above all, a most numerous, well-chosen,
and costly library. He was bred to the
profession of the law, but becoming, by the death
of a relation, possessed of such property as made
the continuance of his professional labours unnecessary,
he retired from it, and afterwards pursued
a life of literary ease and leisure.</p>

<p>He kept a hospitable table, to which he frequently
invited the more distinguished literary characters of
the country. To these he always shewed kindness
and to some whose more necessitous circumstances
required it, he communicated more substantial
assistance. In the margin opposite to the place
where the above sentence appears, the Sexagenarian
had written with a note of admiration thus—“We
are a needy crew!”</p>

<p>One in particular, a foreigner, who was a Fellow
of the Royal Society, and had contributed very
largely to the Philosophical Transactions, and was
also the author of many curious and profound
works on philosophy and chemistry, had perpetual
welcome at his table, and received various proofs
of more solid regard.</p>

<p>His liberality also in accommodating those who
were not fortunate enough to possess literary stores,
equal to his own, with the loan of his treasures,
and his readiness of communicating what he knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
to those who required it, were equally prompt,
kind, and conspicuous.</p>

<p>He had, during that season of the year when
the provinces pour their more opulent, refined and
enlightened inhabitants into the bosom of the metropolis,
weekly meetings of learned and eminent
men, among whom were always to be found some
of the most distinguished characters of the country.</p>

<p>He had much ardour of curiosity with respect to
discoveries and observations in foreign and remote
countries, and particularly directed his attention
towards Africa. He was familiarly acquainted
with all that had, in ancient and modern times also,
been published on the subject of that country, which
still seems to mock the unavailing efforts of all who
attempt to penetrate into its interior recesses. He
did not, however, live to see how much of this obscurity
and darkness had been dissipated by the
generous and patriotic efforts of the African Association,
and by the result of the exertions of
Browne, Hornemann, Park, and others.</p>

<p>Of all the books which our modern æra have produced
on the subject of foreign discovery, he principally
avowed his admiration of Turner’s Embassy
to the court of the Dalai Lama, at Thibet, concerning
which we had previously very little, and indeed
no satisfactory information. He considered this
work as highly valuable and important, and as filling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
up an interesting desideratum in the philosophical
history of man. The extraordinary peculiarities of
religious superstition, which prevail in that country,
the extreme singularity of manners, particularly
those relating to marriage, where it often happens
that one woman is wife to six or seven brothers in
a family, had so much occupied his mind, that it
is more than probable, that his ideas on these subjects
must have been communicated to paper, and
remain among his manuscripts.</p>

<p>Hospitable, kind, and generous, he had one marvellous
weakness, which often produced the most
unpleasing consequences, namely, a childish irritability
of temper.</p>

<p>The wrong label accidentally put upon a decanter,
on one occasion so exasperated him against the
offending servant, that much temporary inconvenience
was occasioned to a large and elegant party,
who were at dinner. These squalls, however, were
short and transitory;—and perhaps more tolerable
than the grimace and adulatory obsequiousness of
“the Traveller,” whose name next succeeds.</p>

<p>Louis has written his own life, restrained by no
very strong considerations of delicacy, nor at all
abashed by the circumstantiality of what he has
disclosed. His parentage, his education, his early
and his late amours, the variety of his efforts to get
on in the world, his obsequiousness to his superiors,
and his final arrival at wealth and independence, are
all communicated without the smallest reserve, as if
his object, aim, principle, first and last determination,
was “<i>Quærenda Pecunia</i>.” He does not seem
much to have cared about the opinions of mankind,
and to have exclaimed with Horace, “<i>Populus me
sibilet</i>,” &amp;c. “<i>ad cœlum jusseris ibo</i>.”</p>

<p>Our Sexagenarian, as appears from his notes, was
very frequently in his society, and though he expresses
himself as greatly pleased and amused with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
his vivacity, his inexhaustible fund of anecdotes,
his knowledge of the world, and it must be said of
books also, indeed he knew something of every
thing, yet he evidently felt no strong disposition to
give him his esteem.</p>

<p>There was a man in the time of Gray, and of the
same college with the Bard, whose name was
Etough, or Etoph. He had been brought up
among the most rigid Dissenters, but seeing better
prospects before him in our Church establishment,
he took orders. This man, by some means or
other, had made himself acquainted with the secret
history, connections, and particularities, of all the
great families in the kingdom.</p>

<p>On account of this knowledge, though exceedingly
disliked, and indeed despised, he was very
much courted and invited to entertainments. Our
friend Louis greatly resembled him. He was for
some years resident abroad, in a situation which
commanded respect, and in a place which all our
young nobility, who make the tour of Europe, never
fail to visit. He was necessarily introduced to their
acquaintance, and thus in succession became informed
of the more important circumstances involved
in the history of their respective families.</p>

<p>This he turned to very good account, so good
indeed, that his domestic expences were always on
a very limited scale. The invitations he received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span> to
dinner, in the full season, were perpetual, and there
were many considerable houses, at which a place
was always left for him, without the formality of
previous notice.</p>

<p>To the very last period of life, he retained his
vivacity of intellect, and great activity of body.
When turned of seventy, he played billiards with
great spirit, and practised all the finesse of the
Queue with considerable success.</p>

<p>It was whimsical enough, that never having acquired
a sufficient knowledge of the English language,
to read or converse in it without an offensive
intermixture of his foreign idiom, he should
have valuable preferment in the Church bestowed
upon him. He had the good sense not to attempt
any professional duties, and some ludicrous stories
are told of the surprize and astonishment excited
among his northern auditors, when he first appeared
among them to take possession of his living.</p>

<p>He died rich, which indeed might be expected,
for he saved much and spent little; independent
of what he received from one noble family, his pension,
and his living, he did not inherit less than
twenty-four thousand pounds from two other personages
of rank, to whom, for a continued series
of years, he had paid assiduous and obsequious
attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>In his account of himself, he slurs over the circumstance
of his being most affectionately received,
and most generously entertained, by his relations
in this country; but the fact is, on his arrival he
went to the house of his uncle, who had retired
from the business of a jeweller with a handsome
fortune, and for many years resided in Leicester-square.
When the subject of this article died, he
left a niece, who had kept his house, but whether
she was a daughter of this uncle above-mentioned,
or not, was not known to the writer. Whoever she
might be, he left her but a scanty provision.</p>

<p>Though frivolity and levity would better characterize
him, than to call him a lover of science and
philosophy, yet the book he wrote on the discoveries
of the ancients, attributed to the moderns, and his
edition of the works of Leibnitz, demonstrate him
capable of profounder thinking, and evidently prove
that he was well acquainted with books.</p>

<p>In the matter in which he was involved with the
venerable Archbishop of Moscow, he does not
stand in quite so fair a light. He committed himself
unadvisedly, nor was his explanation quite
perspicuous or satisfactory. Take him for all in all,
he was an eccentric character, and if we do not
meet with his like again, it is of no material importance.</p>

<p>Numerous are the anecdotes which occur in our
manuscript, as communicated by this singular personage,
but lest our detail should be too far extended,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
one only is inserted.</p>

<p>A society was established under the most fortunate
auspices, of which, the object was, to bring
together individuals, who from their relative situations
in life, were otherwise less likely to meet upon
equal and familiar terms: men of rank, properly
so denominated, and those who had exhibited such
unequivocal proofs of learning and of talent, as to
claim and deserve that countenance, which the
conscious dignity of superior intellect is seldom
disposed to solicit. Accordingly, the first promoters
of the plan endeavoured, in the invitations
which they circulated, to assemble personages of
distinction, who were universally considered and
acknowledged as friendly to the interests of literature,
and men of literary character, whose studies
and productions had conciliated the general esteem.</p>

<p>To Louis this seemed a mighty fantastical
project, and as the invitation immediately came
from one, who, though much employed, and exceedingly
anxious in the business, did not add much
to its allurement, from the splendour of his rank,
or the popularity of his name; he declined it with
a sort of faint praise and civil sneer, at the same
time undertaking to predict that the scheme would
fall to the ground. But it turned out far otherwise.
The success exceeded the most sanguine hopes of
the first projectors. In a very short space of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>time,
the society comprehended a very large proportion
of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The great, and the good, and the learned, and the wise.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It would not be very easy to describe the mortification
and chagrin which was felt by him, who
had rejected, what he would afterwards have made
great sacrifices to obtain. But it was too late.
The door was shut, not again to be opened to any
force, within his power to apply.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

</div>

<p>The Sexagenarian has, in various parts of his
manuscript, introduced detached remarks and anecdotes
on the subject of book clubs, literary societies,
and meetings of similar denomination.</p>

<p>He seems to have been a member of one in particular,
which must have communicated no ordinary
satisfaction, as he has sketched a concise delineation
of the individuals of whom it was composed, which
is here introduced, to exercise the acuteness of
those who may be disposed to appropriate the
several descriptions and portraits.</p>

<p>The first was a Barrister; a man of singular
acuteness, great vigour of intellect, extensive knowledge
of modern languages, particularly of French,
a very subtle disputant, and never perhaps exceeded
in conversation talents. In the time of Louis XIV.
it was notorious that the great wits of the day, bestowed
a portion of their morning hours, in preparing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
themselves to shine in the parties they were
to meet in the evening, by making themselves familiar
with such subjects as were likely to be introduced,
by contriving such verbal artifices as might
afford them the opportunity of introducing new jests,
puns, jeux des mots, and so forth.</p>

<p>Our legal friend laboured under a somewhat
similar imputation, but be this as it may, his talents
were of the very highest order, and though perhaps in
many of his opinions, and more particularly in those
concerning politics, he did not coincide with any
one member of the Symposium, he was greatly
acceptable to all, from the vivacity of his communications,
the easy flow of his eloquence, his diversified
narratives, and urbanity of manners.</p>

<p>He qualified himself for professional distinction
by severe application, and he long and patiently
endured the “<i>res angusti domi</i>,” with the hope of
progressively making his way to more lucrative
business. But this seemed still to linger at a distance;
he was, however, too high-spirited to be
easily turned aside from his purpose, and too confident
in his own natural and acquired attainments,
to despair of finally accomplishing his object. Two
things occurred, which attracted the public attention
towards him, and made him the object of more
general attention and curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>He undertook to be the advocate of the French
Revolution in its primordial state, and produced a
work upon the subject, which became the fertile
parent of disputation, replies, rejoinders, and commentaries.</p>

<p>He also read public lectures on legal subjects,
which were numerously attended, and exhibited
unequivocal demonstration of his abilities. He might
probably not have been obliged to court the office
which he afterwards and honourably filled, but for
the pertinacity of his political opinions, and his
strenuous opposition, on all occasions, to the measures
of government.</p>

<p>This pertinacity, however, so far, gave way at
length, that he accepted from ministers a judicial
situation in one of the remote dependencies of the
empire, where he resided for several years. His
acceptance of this office was considered by his party
as tergiversation, and he was reproached by them
accordingly. One example of this reproach is commemorated
as having been made by a very distinguished
friend of opposition, on the occasion of the
trial of O’Connor and his friends at Maidstone.
It is too well known to require repetition.</p>

<p>At length he returned to his native country, and
great were the political changes which had occurred
in the interval of his absence. What did he do?
It might have been supposed that government possessed
some claims upon his gratitude; it might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
have been presumed, that having witnessed the follies
and the pernicious effects of the revolutionary
principles he had once advocated, he would shrink
from the peril of being even the suspected partisan
of a power which had been exercised to the destruction
of every thing, which by the wise and the good
was contemplated with the strongest attachment
and sincerest veneration. He nevertheless went
back to the Magi, by whom he had formerly been
deluded, and was quickly initiated in all the greater
and lesser ceremonies of the Gallic Eleusis, Madame
de S. being the high-priestess.</p>

<p>It was, however, reported of him, that even in
the midst of his wanderings in the labyrinths of
politics, he not only meditated, but actually commenced,
a great and arduous historical labour, to
which his talents were fully adequate, and which
promised to place his name on a pedestal, far more
lofty and substantial too, than any fabrick which
could possibly be raised by a subtle, ingenious, but
powerless minority.</p>

<p>On the subject of this gentleman, with the exception
of a few scattered notices, nothing more of
importance appears in our Recollections. There
is reason to apprehend, that at this period, the Sexagenarian
retired from the world, and totally lost
sight of his former associates.</p>

<p>Another individual of the society was a
Member of Parliament, of elegant connections,
elegant manners, and elegant accomplishments. He
had travelled a great deal, and was familiarly acquainted
with most European languages, but he more
particularly directed his attention to the literature
of his own country. In this he was pre-eminently
skilled, and has transmitted proofs of his knowledge
and taste in this way, which will probably endure
as long as the language. His society was peculiarly
agreeable; he had seen a great deal of the
world, was acutely observant, had much to communicate,
which he always was prompt to do, and
which he always did with vivacity, eloquence, and
a considerable degree of <i>dry</i> humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>In earlier life he had attached himself to that
party of which Mr. Fox was the head, and he
exercised his satirical vein at the expence of the
leading members of administration, in the miscellaneous
volume of poetry known by the name of
“the Rolliad.” His first, however, and greatest
delight, was in old English poetry, which in the
manner of Headley, he collected, illustrated, and
it may be said, adorned. His biographical sketches
are remarkable for neatness, precision, and accuracy.
He abounded in anecdote, which, when required,
he detailed with great felicity.</p>

<p>He was for some time in Russia, and had lived
on terms of much familiarity with Prince Potemkin;
of whose luxurious and voluptuous style of
living, he would often relate many extraordinary
particulars. This Prince would have the fish called
the Strelitz, a great delicacy of the table, brought
alive from the Crimea to Petersburg, in relays of
fresh water, stationed at different distances, by
which means, and by the time of their arrival, they
must have cost a most prodigious sum of money.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that this gentleman’s
health might somewhat suffer from the above intimacy.
He was a great valetudinarian, and obliged
to live with the extremest circumspection with regard
to his diet, and to abstain altogether from
wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>He used to tell a facetious story of himself in
an adventure which he met with in the north of
Germany.</p>

<p>He was returning from Petersburg, when by
some accident, he and his servant were detained
on the road, and with much difficulty reached a
miserable village late in the evening. They were
almost famished, but neither the master nor the
servant could make the host comprehend their
wants. They tried all the languages of which
they had knowledge, but none could my host understand.
At length, on looking out of the window,
the servant saw some poultry; on which he
seized the landlord by the arm, and, as loud as he
could, imitated the crowing of a cock. The man
took the hint, and immediately twisted off the necks
of two chickens, on which the travellers supped deliciously.</p>

<p>His health continuing to decline, Mr. ⸺
found himself obliged to withdraw from the different
societies of which he was a member, and altogether
resided at an elegant retirement within
twenty miles of the metropolis. Here he died very
prematurely, leaving behind him a strong impression
of some of the best and most pleasing qualities,
which can and which ought to characterize the
English gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>He was particularly partial to the Symposium,
of which a brief account is here given, and never
failed, as long as it subsisted, to attend its meetings.
He used facetiously to call it his “Petit Baton.”</p>

<p>A third member of this “Symposium” was
perhaps superior to those who have been already
mentioned, in intellectual endowment. He has
written the circumstances of his early life with such
a dignified simplicity, that it is only necessary here
to observe, that by the momentum of talent alone,
directed by discretion and sound judgment, he rose
from the very humblest station in life to an honourable
and merited independence. He was an excellent
scholar, and had superintended the education
of a young nobleman with the highest credit to
himself, and advantage to his pupil. He afterwards
accompanied him to the Continent, where he
successfully availed himself of the opportunities of
his situation, to enlarge his own stores of knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
as well as those of the individual under his care
and direction.</p>

<p>Of his first productions of a literary kind, nothing
perhaps is known, except by himself, and a very
few; but at the period before us, he had already,
by the common acknowledgements of scholars,
greatly adorned the literature of his country. His
primary distinction was a sort of intuitive acuteness,
which enabled him instantly to penetrate into the
real characters of those with whom he communicated,
and to discern the merits and defects of
whatever was submitted to his perusal. This acuteness,
aided by a very strong judgment, gave him
perhaps a particular bias to criticism and to satire.</p>

<p>By one of his performances of this kind, he
effectually put an extinguisher upon a gaudy and
meretricious taste, which, for too long a period, had
been permitted to intrude upon the regions of poetry,
and fraudulently under the guise of polish and
softness, to substitute sound for sense, tinsel for
gold, and a profusion of false and garish metaphors,
for the best and truest embellishments of the art.
Day after day, even to fastidiousness, was the public
nauseated with epistles, odes, and sonnets, and
canzonettas, under the signatures of Rosa, Matilda,
Laura, Yenda, and a hundred others. The honest
indignation and energy of this writer’s Satiric Muse,
swept all these cobwebs away, and they were visible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
no more.</p>

<p>By the fierce resentment of one of these offended
parties, remarkable for the licentiousness of his
sentiments, and the indiscriminate abuse which he
scattered every where around him, our satirist was
once involved in a perilous, but whimsical predicament.
The culprit felt so poignant by the lash,
which had been applied to his shoulders, that after
brooding over his wounds, in sullen, silent malignity,
he determined upon taking personal vengeance. He
was led to this, from the mistaken apprehension,
that courage was proportioned to stature, and that
a little body must necessarily be the depository of
a pusillanimous spirit. He, however, found himself
most egregiously mistaken.</p>

<p>Armed with “a dagger and a pall,” in other
words with a bludgeon and surtout, he contrived to
watch the satirist to his bookseller’s shop, which
he was known to frequent regularly at a certain hour
of the morning. As soon as he had seen his foe
enter, the exasperated poetaster followed him in,
and immediately, without a word of warning, in the
most base and cowardly manner, attempted to strike
his adversary on the head. But he reckoned without
his host. The little man seeing what he was
about, caught his uplifted arm with one hand, and
with the other actively wrested the bludgeon from
his grasp, which he managed with so much dexterity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
and force upon his dastardly adversary, that
the tables were turned, and the assailant was fairly
beaten out of the shop, with marks of his discomfiture,
which he carried for a long time afterwards
manifest on his visage.</p>

<p>Few things have been more extensively circulated
than the satirical poem, alluded to above. It passed
through various editions, and still retains the reputation
it deserves. This effusion, which was limited to
sonnet writers, makers of odes, and Dilettanti scribblers
of that class, was succeeded by an attack managed
with no less ability and skill, on certain theatrical
productions of similar tendency and character,
which for a long time usurped an undue possession
of the stage. This met with the same favourable
reception from the public, and was productive of
equally good consequences.</p>

<p>But the “<i>magnum opus</i>” of this distinguished
personage, is one that will perish only with the
language. It is one which occupied the thoughts
of his earliest years, and was progressively completed,
in the full maturity of his talents. It combines
all the extensive and essential qualities of deep
erudition, acute criticism, sound observation, and
exquisite taste.</p>

<p>In the character in which he is here introduced,
namely, as a member of the Symposium, it is impossible
to conceive any thing more unassuming,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
mild, and agreeable, than his manner and conversation.
Never impatient of contradiction, never
dogmatical in his arguments, he always improved
the “olla podrida” of the meeting, without taking
any merit from the flavour of the sauces, which he
himself contributed to the mess.</p>

<p>When the Sexagenarian retired from the world,
the same personage was still employed in the same
honourable and useful pursuits, which had occupied
the whole of his life, and which had more peculiarly
in view the interest of literature, and the cause
of truth.</p>

<p>At whatever point, and by whatever means, the
evil disposed, were exercising their machinations
against what he conceived to be the honest fame,
and real interest of his country, wherever subtlety
and artifice were employed, by misrepresentations,
to mislead, or by fallacies to attempt imposition on
the public, there was his vigilance prepared to
detect, and his firmness resolved to check any effectual
operation of the mischief. He obtained the
meed he merited, “<i>laudari a laudatis</i>.”</p>

<p>A fourth member of this society was an individual,
than whom, no one’s name has been more
frequently before the public, or accompanied with
more general respect, at the same time, with
much persecution, and great, though undeserved,
odium. Some there were, who, fancying that they
saw the vital spirit of genuine liberty, in the principles
of the French Revolution, were disposed to
palliate enormities, at the bare memory of which,
every feeling heart revolts, under the impression
that they must ultimately lead to the melioration
of man. These individuals reproached our Symposiast
with the imputation of spreading unnecessary
alarms, from an overweening zeal, and officious
interference in political concerns. But this zeal,
these apprehensions, and this interference, contributed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
in the opinions of the majority of the best
and wisest of our countrymen, to the preservation
of the country.</p>

<p>However this may be, the active and patriotic
spirit exerted on the above occasion, spread universally
around, and collected a phalanx, which,
from its firmness, was capable of resisting all
attack, from its vigilance prevented surprize, and
from its consciousness of supporting the good and
honest cause of religion and truth, despised and
defied the artifices of calumny, and the insinuations
of malignity.</p>

<p>The prominent part taken by the gentleman, of
whom we are speaking, necessarily pointed him out
to the government, as a fit object of their protection
and patronage. His abilities and integrity
were accordingly soon exercised in situations of
confidence and honour. He well merited the distinction,
for few have ever been more steady, or
more active in discharging the obligations of official
duty.</p>

<p>At the same time, these very qualities, added to
his former exertions to counteract the fermentation
excited by the turbulent and the evil-minded,
created to him a numerous and formidable host of
adversaries, who, by a thousand means, endeavoured
to disturb his repose and interrupt his measures.
At length a political pamphlet which he wrote, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
admirable distinction of which, was in the first
place its loyalty, and in the next, its “plain good
sense,” attracted the notice of an eminent member
of the Opposition. To this person’s favourite hypothesis
concerning liberty and our constitution, the
above publication appeared to contain principles
of the most dangerous and pernicious hostility.
Nor did he rest till, by his persevering activity, his
eloquence, and his influence, he procured a prosecution
to be instituted against the author.</p>

<p>The result was, however, finally to his honour,
and he was acquitted of the enormous offences with
which he had been charged.</p>

<p>One incident occurred on the occasion of this
memorable trial, which is related in our notes, and
which, if the subject of this article should survive
to peruse these Recollections, he will probably not
forget.</p>

<p>Our Sexagenarian called upon him one morning
previous to the trial, when he had before him a list
of the persons who were summoned on the jury.
He accordingly asked our friend if he knew any
thing of the private characters, or political opinions,
of any of these individuals. On examining the
names, the writer of these notes, fixed on one, to
which for reasons that he stated at length, he recommended
him to desire his counsel to object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>This, however, he either forgot, or was perhaps
too indifferent as to the event, or did not think the
cause of objection on the part of the Sexagenarian,
valid. The result was, that this person was allowed
to sit on the jury, but it afterwards appeared that
the only obstacle to an immediate dismissal of the
charge, arose from the persevering and determined
obstinacy of this individual against whose prejudices
he had been timely, but vainly forewarned.</p>

<p>How much he disregarded and indeed despised
this attempt to lessen his value in the estimation of
the public, was sufficiently evident, indeed somewhat
ludicrously manifested. He never encountered
his great opponent, with whom he had some
previous acquaintance, without forcing himself upon
his notice by exclaiming, how do you do Mr. ⸺?
A salutation which the other would gladly have
avoided and excused.</p>

<p>The person of whom too slight a description is
here given, was educated at Eton, and afterwards
at Oxford. He was called to the bar, and filled
for some time a dignified station in one of our foreign
dependencies. He has, at different times,
published various works, all of which are in the
highest degree honourable to his literary reputation.
He is, or was, a good scholar, a very respectable
lawyer, and had obtained considerable proficiency
in the Oriental languages. He was, moreover, remarkably
well versed in the modern Greek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>As to worldly matters, he certainly played his
cards well with respect to himself, and has proved
to others also no contemptible patron. All have
their infirmities. It is imputed to him, that through
fear of being held up to public animadversion, by
one great political hippopotamos, he occasionally
acquiesced in opinions, which he reprobated, and
paid obsequious attention to one, whom in his heart
he detested. It has also been said, that with a
little exertion he might have rendered effectual
service to some who fought with him with equal
resolution, and who were exposed to equal danger,
under the same honourable standard, but that his
benevolence ended where it began—namely, at
home.</p>

<p>He was, however, in every particular, well qualified
to be a member of the society, the component
individuals of which are here imperfectly delineated.</p>

</div>

<p>Another considerable personage belonged to
this Symposium, whose entrance into life was
marked with promises, which he subsequently
failed to fulfil. He had every advantage of family,
education, connection, and situation; he had considerable
learning, and was by no means destitute
of talent. He was of very elegant and agreeable
manners, and must necessarily have been a very
acceptable member of any society, which assembled
for the purpose of indulging enlightened and interesting
conversation.</p>

<p>But he was appointed to some diplomatic situation
abroad, and he continued for many years absent
from England. Whether he had put the poisoned
chalice of infidelity to his lips before his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
departure, is uncertain; but he appeared to have
employed his leisure in searching for objections and
arguments, as they related to Scripture, which had
been so often refuted, that they were considered by
the learned and the wise, as almost exploded. This
gentleman, however, collected, and made a book
of them, which certainly has done no honour to his
reputation, in any sense whatever.</p>

<p>He was, moreover, a poet, but here also he discovered
a perverted and fantastical taste, having
dramatized one of the most exceptionable and unnatural
tales in the whole collection of Ovid’s Metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Notice is not pretended to be taken, in our memoranda,
of the literary productions of this gentleman
with any thing like chronological accuracy;
they seem to have been written down merely as the
recollection of them presented itself. He got considerable
credit, and deservedly too, by a spirited
translation of a very crabbed Latin poet, though
severer critics seemed inclined to consider it rather
as a paraphrase than as a translation. However
this may be, the version was, undoubtedly, highly
spirited and poetical.</p>

<p>But an earlier, if not absolutely his first literary
effort, was a speculative investigation on the subject
of ancient Greek politics. This was characterized
by much sound sense, and very extensive reading,
subject to the imputation of a style somewhat too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
inflated.</p>

<p>A later production exhibited a metaphysical
labyrinth, in which the author bewildered himself,
and confused his readers. Among the more remarkable
paradoxes which this work contained,
and it contained a great many, was the preposterous
supposition that Newton’s Principia, was an Atheistical
system, and that the philosophy of Bacon
was unsound and erroneous. His partiality to
Helvetius, Delaplace, and the French school, demonstrate
the perverse tendency of his mind, on
religious subjects, which indeed, even in conversation,
and it is even said in female conversation
too, he was at no pains to conceal.</p>

<p>As a Symposiast, however, his talents would
have done honour to the Athenian academy itself,
and it is hoped that time and reflection may have
meliorated and amended those opinions, which it
is impossible that any religious character can approve.</p>

<p>Two other individuals compleated the number
of Symposiasts, of one of whom some mention has
already been made, the other was the Sexagenarian
himself.</p>

<p>To the former, a tribute of affection has been
paid, which he who compiled the heterogeneous
matter of these pages, can testify to have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span> well-deserved.
We are inclined to make some mention
of the latter, as we knew him in the decline of
life.</p>

<p>His earlier years have been pourtrayed by himself
in a preceding part of the work, but ah! how
changed was he in his latter days! His characteristic
of mind was an extraordinary quickness;
his characteristic of temper was cheerfulness. The
first of these qualities he retained as long as we
knew him. He could compose any thing in prose
or in verse, as the physicians say, “<i>pro re nata</i>,”
with a facility which seemed hardly credible, and
with an accuracy which excited surprize. He has
been known to write a sermon in the evenings
which he preached on the following morning. In
four mornings he wrote a book, which he intended
as an amusement for his children. Some friends
recommended him to print it, and though many
years have elapsed since it was written, it still
continues so great a favourite with younger readers,
that an edition is every year published.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>In one morning, indeed in a few hours, he turned
into verse that beautiful chapter of Ecclesiasticus,
in which Wisdom praiseth herself, and expatiates
on her accomplishments. Whoever is desirous of
examining with what effect this task was performed,
has only to refer to the translation of Bishop
Lowth’s Lectures on Isaiah, by Dr. Gregory, at
whose request he so employed himself. Other
examples might be specified, but these seem
enough.</p>

<p>With respect to his characteristic cheerfulness,
sooth to say, he had some hard trials; he had such
an unsuspecting frankness of temper, that there
could not be an easier task than to impose upon
him. In more than one instance, he was defrauded
of large sums of money, eventually to have been
received, by a hasty confidence in plausible manners
and fallacious representations. Knavery was
greatly aided in every artifice and stratagem against
his interest, by two things. The first was his necessities.
He had a large family, and nothing to
educate and maintain them, but what his activity
and abilities provided. Consequently, he had
never any thing in store, but as he used to say of
himself, was obliged to scramble on in life as well
as he could. Under such circumstance, a smaller
immediate benefit was caught at, than one which,
though splendid, was only visible at a distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>The other auxiliary of knavery, was our friend’s
impatience of temper. He could not endure delay,
or any thing in the shape of procrastination. Whatever
was to be done, was to be done quickly. He
considered any thing like a process, as insupportable
tediousness. There are many subtle spirits
on the watch for individuals of such infirmities;
and of such spirits, he was more than once the
victim.</p>

<p>One other trial was bitterness itself, but as he
himself has detailed it with no ordinary pathos,
the circumstances need not here be revived. This
also originated in a too easy disposition to believe
every man honest who appeared so, and from his
never exercising his mind to discover, beneath the
veil of vivacity and good humour, the most nefarious
intentions, and most abominable dishonesty.</p>

<p>This last event certainly preyed upon his mind,
broke his spirits, impaired his health, and materially
deteriorated his circumstances. Yet through this
dark and oppressive gloom, rays of cheerfulness
would often penetrate, enlivening himself and his
connections with hopes of better days to come.</p>

<p>As life continued to wear itself away, he appears
to have had his full share of those dark days, which,
however, afflicting from their pressure, tend to render
the prospect of the grave less formidable. As
was before remarked, he abruptly withdrew himself
from the ken of those, to whom his society had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
familiar, and not undesireable.</p>

<p>Where or when, or under what circumstances,
he ultimately paid the last awful tribute of nature,
are not known with sufficient accuracy to admit of
being introduced in our narrative. He does not,
however, appear to have been altogether without
consolation. Where a tree shoots out into many
branches, some will be goodlier, more vigorous,
and more productive than others. Some will bear
fruit which is sweet and nutritious; some will bear
none at all. In this respect he shared the common
lot of humanity, but where he had cause he was,
nevertheless, uncomplaining, except in the soft
whispers of family confidence. He used, however,
a bolder and a louder tone to one lofty personage,
who volunteered to be the instrument of obtaining
for him compensation for one of the greatest injuries
and afflictions, which can either be encountered
or sustained. Great, certain, and immediate loss,
as to property, was not the sorest of the evils; this
was exasperated by the sneers of the envious, the
insinuations of the invidious, the taunts of the
malignant,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>Conscious integrity, however, ere long, armed
him with a dignified confidence, but he never spoke
without indignation of the great man above alluded
to, who after raising his hopes to the highest pitch,
smiled, and smiled, and smiled, and deserted him.</p>

<p>Of his talents and attainments, it is necessary to
say but little. The productions of his pen again
and again appeared before the public, on various
occasions, and in a great multitude of shapes. Most
of his works were received with respect, and many
are still popular. Some unfinished things remained
among his papers, and there are a few scattered
memoranda in our Recollections, from which it
appears that he had others in contemplation.</p>

<p>To specify some of these can do no harm, and
may perhaps be the means of inducing others to
exercise their leisure on the different subjects.</p>

<p>He had commenced and prosecuted to some
extent, an elaborate Essay on the Revival of Learning,
which he purposed to enliven by a variety of
literary anecdotes, illustrative of an æra so greatly,
and so honourably distinguished. He had also prepared
biographical sketches of the most eminent and
learned of those Greeks, who, when Constantinople
was taken and plundered by the Turks, under Mahomet
II. in 1453, took refuge in Italy, and found
a secure and hospitable asylum in the protection of
the illustrious house of Medici, at Florence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>The principal names of these accomplished exiles,
with very learned and interesting details concerning
them, may be found in Hodius de illustribus
Græcis, a work not so well known as it deserves.</p>

<p>The Sexagenarian had also collected many curious
particulars concerning the celebrated Florentine
library, the foundation of which was laid by
the learned Greeks above alluded to, who were sent
back to their country, by the magnificent Lorenzo,
to rescue from barbarian hands, the literary treasures,
which they had been compelled to forsake.
One anecdote occurs among the memoranda, relating
to this library, which seems to merit insertion,
and is detailed in the following words in the Recollections,
but without reference to the authority from
whence it was taken.</p>

<p>On the expulsion of the house of Medici from
Florence, that city was occupied by the troops of
Charles the VIIIth. and the library, with the possessions
of the illustrious owners, fell into the hands
of the French. The King of England at that time,
Henry VIII., employed emissaries to purchase of
the French officers and soldiers, as many books and
manuscripts as they could possibly obtain. Whether
before or after their arrival in this country,
has not been ascertained, but Catherine of Medicis
had the artifice and address to procure their restoration,
on the pretence of their being the property<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
of her family; this portion, therefore, whatever it
might have been, now forms part of the royal library
at Paris.</p>

<p>The residue of this splendid library remained at
Florence, till the popularity of Cardinal John de
Medicis, afterwards Pope Leo X. seemed to open
to him a reasonable prospect of succeeding to the
papal throne. At this juncture, Soderini was Dictator
of Florence, who, anxious to remove from the
Cardinal every remaining temptation to revisit
Florence, collected what was yet left of the library,
and dispatched the whole to him at Rome, as a
present, conceiving himself thus to have performed
an act of great political sagacity. Thus, therefore,
the contents of this magnificent repository of literary
treasure was divided, and such a proportion of
them will be found in the Vatican, as the French,
in their different predatory excursions, suffered to
remain.</p>

<p>Another of the Sexagenarian’s meditated works,
was one or more Dissertations upon Emblems, a
species of literature which at one period greatly occupied
the attention of the curious, upon which the
exalted talents of the first poets and artists were
formerly exercised, and of which there are many
specimens of extraordinary rarity and beauty. He
had evidently revolved the subject much in his mind,
to which he was induced by the consideration, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
nothing of the kind had ever appeared in the English
language. Such a work certainly might be
made a vehicle of great and various entertainment,
by a judicious introduction of literary anecdotes,
and by well-chosen specimens from the different
performances.</p>

<p>It also appears that a work of some extent on the
present state of literature, and literary men, in this
country, had been nearly compleated. It was
written in the administration of Mr. Pitt, and was
inscribed to the Right Hon. W. Windham. The
idea originated, in what was perhaps a misconception,
that literature was on the decline among us,
from the want of patrons. As he advanced in life,
he was probably convinced that he was in error, for
the work was never published, and as it should
seem, never finished.</p>

<p>Our friend had also prepared for publication,
some notes on two plays of Shakspeare. He,
somewhere in “the Recollections,” confesses, that
he was prompted to this, by a wish to exercise the
irritable curiosity of George Stevens. He first
began with intimating in some Morning Paper, the
intention of examining the edition of Shakspeare by
Malone, then recently published, with the hint that
the critical attention of the author would also be
extended to all the other annotators. Several
columns were accordingly filled with notes on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span> the
Tempest. The bait took, Mr. S. ever restless and
impatient where Shakspeare was concerned, used
every effort in his power to discover the author,
and even condescended to reply to some of his observations,
through the same channel of communication
with the public. But he did not succeed;
the work, however, became, in its progress, so very
amusing, that annotations on two plays were ready
for publication. Something more serious, in all
probability, diverted his attention from this lighter
employment, which he seems to have laid aside
altogether.</p>

<p>Preparations were also made for a publication
of a facetious kind. He proposed to give an account
of the witty publications of earlier days, and
had taken as a motto,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Jest and youthful jollity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quips and cranks and wanton wiles,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Sport that wrinkled care derides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And laughter holding both his sides.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following books formed part of the stores
from which he intended to have extracted his materials.</p>

<h3>THE MODERN PARSON ADAMS.</h3>

<p>It has generally been believed, that the prototype
of Parson Adams, as delineated by Fielding in his
Joseph Andrews, was Dr. Young, the author of
the Night Thoughts. The picture has been considered
as outrageously caricatured, and indeed it
can hardly be conceived that such intellectual qualities
and attainments could possibly be accompanied
by such total ignorance of society, and such
extreme and almost ridiculous simplicity of mind
and manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>Yet from some detached and irregular memoranda
in our manuscript, it should seem that our
Sexagenarian actually met with, and had frequent
and familiar communication with, a character, resembling
in many of its features and distinctions,
the admirable portrait of the novelist.</p>

<p>Of his origin, or earlier life, nothing is remembered,
nor is it material. It appears, however,
that having been educated at one of the city public
schools, Merchant Taylors’, or St. Paul’s, he removed
from thence to the University. He was
nearly cotemporary with Porson, and being of the
same college, and with similar studious propensities,
a sort of intimacy took place between them.
Their attainments, however, differed very materially,
both in quality and extent. Porson’s were
exercised on very various ramifications of knowledge;
the individual, here alluded to, confined his
investigations, and employed all his talents, on
one object only, the Greek language, in which he
was certainly and eminently skilful. It might be
said to him,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Græcum te Albuti quam Romanum atque Sabinum</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Municipem Ponti, Titi, Anni, centurio num</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Præclarorum hominum, ac primum signiferumque</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Maluisti dici.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Soon after his leaving the University, he married,
but never was wight more remarkably unqualified
for the superintendence of a family, and the regulation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
of a limited income. The consequence may
be easily imagined; and in no long interval, he
found himself so overwhelmed with pecuniary obligations
and perplexities, that ruin stared him in
the face.</p>

<p>The venerable and excellent Bishop Porteus,
estimating his literary attainments in their due proportion,
and perfectly satisfied that his difficulties
arose from no acts of personal indiscretion, or of
moral inaccuracy, but from entire ignorance of the
world, and from his mind being constantly absorbed
in his favourite pursuits, gave him preferment.
Two other friends also evinced so much
and such successful activity in his behalf, that he
was enabled to weather the storm, and he subsequently
retired to a situation, where he was not
exposed to similar perplexities, and was enabled,
without molestation, to pursue the path in which
he most delighted.</p>

<p>It might be added, that the art of memory was
not among those which he most successfully cultivated.
Upon some subsequent occasion, he to
all appearance forgot one at least of those friends,
and the assistance which their active kindness enabled
them to administer to his necessities.</p>

<p>Perhaps enough has been said, but lest the subject
of this notice, if he survives, should feel his
pride wounded on reading this narrative, it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>most
willingly added in continuation, that more amiable
manners could no where be found. His mind
always appeared, and really was, uncontaminated
by the dissimulation and hypocrisy of modern refinement;
and it may be affirmed, with the small
exception above cited, that he was invariably kind,
friendly, and benevolent.</p>

<p>But his ignorance of the world, and of the human
character, frequently subjected him to be imposed
upon. He was sincere himself, and never suspected
the deficiency of that quality in others. He was a
conscientious and pious Christian, and did not think
it possible that infidelity could lurk under the specious
mask of liberality, candour, a general taste
for literature, a partiality for some of our popular
ecclesiastical writers, and an avowed zeal for
moral order.</p>

<p>He would not indeed have exposed himself to the
ribaldry and indignity of a rabid Trulliber, but in
the ordinary concerns of life, and in the barters
which necessarily occur in domestic economy, he
was unable to distinguish the genuine from the spurious
commodity, and knew no more of the mysteries
of the drawing-room, or the sacred trifles of
politeness, than Slingsby of criticism, or Gabrielli
of Greek. Could but these worthies have seen
him enter a room,</p>

<p>Whilst, on the other hand, he would not fail to
be received with gratulation and applause by a hundred

<p>This gentleman more than once appeared before
the public as an author; but such a style, at least
when he wrote in English, was never paralleled,
except among the Houynhyms! There was much
sound learning, sense, judgment, and knowledge,
at the bottom, but so thick a cloud was suspended
over the surface, that it was only here and there,
at intervals, through partial fissures of light, that
what was valuable and useful could be discerned.
“It was like the gracious fooling when thou
spakest of the Pigrogromitus, and of the Vapians
passing the equinoctial of Quembus.”</p>

<p>Nobody was surely less qualified to be a biographical
writer, for reasons above stated; he was
unable to discern the real character, or to distinguish
between the tinsel and embroidery of the
courtier’s polish, and the real and solid substance
and qualities of the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>There was one other person well known to
the Sexagenarian, to whom the above description
will apply in so many particulars, that it is not
impossible but a false application might be
made.</p>

<p>That other person was H⸺, a clergyman of
Norfolk. He was alike versed in the depths and
intricacies of Aristotelian lore, and even knew the
opinion of Pythagoras about wild fowl; at the same
time, he was equally ignorant of the world, and
unacquainted with the forms of polished society.
The style of writing in both, when they appeared as
authors, was alike uncouth, and regardless of the
ornaments of composition. But whilst the one,
(that is, the individual first described) was perfectly
unoffending, and never violated, though he
might not practise, the forms and rules of good
breeding, the latter was abrupt in his manner,
rude and disputatious in conversation, and exceedingly
disgusting in his habits.</p>

<p>He would, without scruple or compunction,
offend the delicacy of his hostess by contaminating
the hues of her carpets, the brightness of her
stoves, and the purity of her bed-curtains, by
defiling each with the distillations of tobacco.
But he was, nevertheless, a truly good, and amiable,
and profoundly learned man. The few works
he published continue, and always will continue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
in high estimation with the learned, for the sagacity
of his remarks, the acuteness of his discrimination,
and the depth of his erudition.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

</div>

<p>In no part of these pages will be found a more
eccentric, and, at the same time, accomplished
scholar and amiable man, than the individual,
memorandums concerning whom, at this place present
themselves.</p>

<p>His father was a sound theologian, and popular
preacher. His various works on subjects of divinity
still continue of high reputation. He was the
intimate friend of Bishop Hoadley, Archbishop
Herring, Dr. Clarke, and other illustrious members
of our Church.</p>

<p>He left three sons, all of whom were greatly distinguished
as scholars and divines. The youngest
of these, Philip, with whom we have to do, was
for a number of years intimately known to the
Sexagenarian, and may, without impropriety, perhaps,
be denominated his first literary patron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Though considerably advanced in life, he took
great pleasure in conversing with our friend, then
very young, upon scholastic subjects, and afforded
him much aid and encouragement in the prosecution
of his literary pursuits. He had a valuable
collection of classics, with which he was intimately
conversant, many of the best of which he gave to
his <i>protegé</i>. With respect to literature, his mind
was somewhat of a singular cast. He knew nothing
of modern languages, and in fact despised them.
He had the same feelings as to the Belles Lettres.
Latin and Greek authors comprised all that he
studied; the Septuagint and Greek Testament all
that he venerated.</p>

<p>A few of our old divines, and more particularly
Bishop Hoadley, Dr. Clarke, and his father, were
high in his estimation; but, generally speaking, he
had rather the disposition to despise all modern
writers.</p>

<p>His habits of life partook of the singularities of
his opinions. Every day, when the weather permitted,
he took a very long walk of many miles
with his wife, whose personal appearance, character,
and manners, were little, if at all less eccentric
than those of her husband.</p>

<p>But the information or amusement communicated
on either side could not be very great, for the gentleman
invariably walked at least a hundred yards
in advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>He lived plainly, but exceedingly well, allowing
himself a bottle of wine every day, about his management
of which, he was also remarkably whimsical.
He had no wine-cellar, but every day, within half
an hour of dinner, his servant went to the tavern
for a bottle of port. This he divided into two
equal parts, one of which he drank at dinner,
which at that time was at three o’clock, the other
at supper, which was precisely at nine. His wife,
he said, or any accidental guest, might have what
they pleased, but “not a drop of his” for any
body.</p>

<p>He had the further peculiarity of drinking his
wine out of a jelly glass, with a large wide foot,
and this he did from the apprehension that some
of the numerous four-footed animals which filled
his house might throw it down.</p>

<p>The fondness, which he and his wife encouraged
for the feline species, was really ridiculous. When
the door was opened, it, in some degree, resembled
the opening of a dog-kennel, nor were the olfactory
nerves less annoyed. Black, white, tabbies, tortoise-shell,
grimalkins of all kinds and colours,
rushed from every opening, to the great annoyance
of the visitor.</p>

<p>Unluckily, there was a large school of boys in
the vicinity of the old gentleman’s residence.
There was, of course, an open declaration of hostilities
between the “young dogs” and these cats.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
He was often exasperated almost to frenzy, by what
he termed their abominable barbarity, and used to
indulge himself in severe reproaches against the
master, for not inculcating more forcible lessons of
gentleness and humanity. His acquaintances were
very few, and his guests fewer. With the exception
of one old gentleman, a clergyman, of a character
not less whimsical than his own, and occasionally,
but very rarely indeed, the son of this
friend, his dinners were invariably tête-a-tête.</p>

<p>He possessed in manuscript, sermons of his father,
and of both his brothers; he had also composed
a considerable number himself. The characteristic
of them all was sound good sense, very
seldom deviating into the subtleties of speculation,
but strongly and earnestly enforcing religious and
virtuous practice. It occurred to him, that the
publication of these discourses might produce a
sum of importance to the assistance of a County
Hospital, then recently established. They were
accordingly printed, and so far succeeded, that the
charity was benefited to the amount of three or
four hundred pounds. But the work appeared
with this peculiarity, that the reader was left to
exercise his sagacity in discovering what discourses
were the composition of the father, and what of
the brothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>In taking leave of this worthy character, it is
observed in our “Recollections,” that he was a
man of strong mind, and sound judgment, acute,
and intelligent. Taste he had none, and indeed
despised what is commonly so called.</p>

<p>What is more to his honour is, that he was
friendly, affectionate, prompt in works of benevolence,
and anxious to communicate assistance upon
whatever occasion it was required.</p>

<p>The old clergyman, his friend, above alluded to,
as being of a like eccentric character, was one of
those personages who are not often met with in society.
He was an excellent scholar, and had much
taste and judgment, but he passed the whole of a
long life in studied obscurity. He had some paternal
fortune, and he married a woman of considerable
property.</p>

<p>But from the habit of living in a retired village
after the death of his wife, with an old crone of a
servant, he contracted habits of the extremest parsimony,
of which his son experienced the good
effects, for he died prodigiously rich. But mark,
it was not till after his death. He did indeed send
his son to college, but his allowance was so niggardly
bestowed, that he was often put to his
shifts. After taking his degree, he was obliged to
submit to the drudgery of being usher in a large
school. He afterwards married respectably, but
nothing could he obtain from his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>There was one trait in the old gentleman’s character
so highly to his honour, that it may well be
set as a counterpoise against his infirmity of avarice.
He had the most rigid sentiments of honour.
He was connected with a noble family, who offered
him the living of the place where they resided, but
on this condition, that he should sign bonds of resignation
in case of being called upon to vacate his
preferment: but he refused the offer with disdain;
and though he might eventually, perhaps, with a
little worldly management, have succeeded on his
own terms, he never condescended to take any step
whatever in the business, but continued to the end
of life, curate of the village of which he might have
been the rector.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

</div>

<p>The remarks and sketches which are subjoined,
appear to have been among those which were last
written in our Sexagenarian’s Recollections. They
were evidently written under strong emotions of
mind, and to have been intended for a longer and
better digested dissertation. He observes in a sort
of concise introduction, that they were suggested
in consequence of a visit which he paid to the
place of his nativity, after an absence of twenty
years. His astonishment was great, and his
sympathy strongly excited, by discovering on enquiry,
that, with some few exceptions, a total<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
change had taken place among the persons whom
he once more familiarly knew. That the rich were
become poor, and the poor rich; that many who
formerly had influenced the politics, directed the
counsels, and commanded the reverence of their
fellow-citizens, had been precipitated by Fortune
to the bottom of her wheel. On the contrary, that
others, who had filled humble and even menial
offices, were in lofty situations, discharging the
higher functions of their little Republic, building
palaces, and rolling in wealth.</p>

<p>The contemplation of these events induced him
to turn the matter more seriously in his mind, and
to exercise his memory upon such individuals, as
in the progress of life he had personally known,
who from humble origin, and no other pretensions
than those which, though honourable in themselves,
are not always successful, namely, diligence and
talent, had risen to stations of great dignity and
emolument.</p>

<p>Happy Britain! our Sexagenarian on this occasion
exclaims, happy beyond all other nations,
where alone, between the lowest and most exalted
station, no obstacle is interposed, which genius
cannot subdue, and perseverance remove.</p>

<p>The Recollections next present us with a somewhat
extended catalogue of illustrious names,
whose lives and success exemplify the above remark,
which perhaps exclusively applies to this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
our country. The following is prefixed as a sort
of preliminary observation.</p>

<p>The profession of arms is perhaps that alone, in
which success and exaltation, even to the loftiest
height of rank, excites no surprize, and provokes
no envy. The qualities of personal valour combined
with military talent, is that which obtains,
extends, and secures the glory of a nation, in which
every individual participates, and is more or less
anxious to reward.</p>

<p>From the time of the great Marlborough to the
period of the immortal Nelson, this sort of prepossession
in favour of military valour has existed,
whether manifested by sea or by land.</p>

<p>Perhaps also great elevation to dignity and wealth
in the profession of the law, is contemplated with
comparatively little jealousy, or invidious feelings.
There are certain stations to be filled, and certain
functions to be performed, which can only properly
be sustained by the momentum of sound professional
knowledge, aided by great natural ability.
Little surprize or discontent was therefore excited
or expressed on the elevation of those great
characters, personally known to the Sexagenarian—Lords
Thurlow, Rosslyn, Mansfield, Erskine, Bathurst,
Camden, Ashburton, and various others.</p>

<p>Nor in the list of names which follow, is any
thing further presumed to be intimated, than that
good fortune came in aid of superior talents and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
great real merit, with such exceptions and qualifications
as readers may choose to make, according
to their respective feelings and prejudices, as well
as from the extent of their personal knowledge.</p>

<p>The first name which presents itself, is that of
Lord S. Though being educated in the profession
of the law, he may in some degree be considered
as belonging to that class, whose elevation excites
little surprize, and seldom, if ever, provokes invidiousness
of remark. Yet Lord S. certainly does
not come under the denomination of a Law Lord.
He owed his great elevation to political pursuits
and connections, and by no means to his professional
acquirements, whatever these might be.</p>

<p>He was the son of a physician, which physician
was not only the professional adviser, but the confidential
friend of the great Lord C. The subsequent
connection between the two sons of these
personages, as it commenced in youth, was cemented
in the progress of years, and confirmed by
congenial propensities.</p>

<p>Through the influence and friendship of Mr. P.
Mr. A. rose, in no very dilatory succession, to the
peerage, and to the very exalted station of Prime
Minister of the country, exhibiting, perhaps, what
rarely occurs, and never but in Britain, an instance,
of prosperous fortune, the result of unimpeachable
integrity, and undeviating perseverance, rather
than of any very extraordinary intellectual endowments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>The two brothers also, who fill, honourably fill,
the great and dignified stations, one at the head of
the law, the other of Judge of the High Court of
C⸺y, exhibit no less memorable examples of
success and opulence. Perhaps these distinguished
persons might not improperly be classed among
those, whose elevation reasonably accompany their
meritorious exertions. But the fortunes of men
sometimes turn upon very slight hinges; and of
the most illustrious of the two, it is reported, that
after having for a considerable time attempted,
without success, to obtain business at the bar in
the metropolis, he had resolved to return to the
place of his nativity in the north, and there practice
as a Chamber Counsellor. Fortune, however,
determined otherwise. The death, or the indisposition
of some eminent barrister, engaged in a
cause of extraordinary interest and importance,
rendered it essential to the parties to employ immediately
as a substitute, one who had sufficient
leisure to devote himself to the business, and at
the same time who possessed legal character and
knowledge adequate to the arduousness of the
cause in hand.</p>

<p>Sir John (then Mr. S⸺) was distinguished by
both these requisites, and so distinguished himself
upon the occasion, that all thoughts of removal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
were instantly laid aside, and his progress to
wealth, reputation, and the highest dignities, were
as rapid as can well be imagined.</p>

<p>The advancement of the second brother to dignity
and wealth was continual and uninterrupted,
and perhaps, as far as riches are concerned, they
possess between them enough to satisfy even
avarice itself.</p>

<p>The extraordinary rise of the present Earl
to the elevated rank he now holds, demonstrates
the caprice of fortune, “ludum insolentem,
ludere pertinax,” as much perhaps, or more, than
any other example that ever the country can
display.</p>

<p>He was first known to our Sexagenarian at College,
and his prospects in life were as humble as
can well be imagined. His father was a Norfolk
clergyman, residing on a benefice of no very considerable
value. His own destination was that of a
clergyman also, and he entered life with no better
hopes than present themselves to the generality of
young men on leaving the University, without the
claims of high connection, or the consciousness of
extraordinary talents.</p>

<p>Luckily for him, his brother rapidly rose to the
highest honours of his profession, and in the progress
of a most glorious career, too short, alas!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
for his country, manifested such claims to the public
gratitude, that he was elevated to the illustrious
distinction of an Earldom. In the midst of this
splendid scene, the present Lord N. who had retained
his College acquaintance with the Sexagenarian,
applied to him for advice, as to the surest
means of obtaining ecclesiastical preferment, through
the interest of his brother, who was then only Sir
H. N.</p>

<p>Such a procedure as suggested itself was accordingly
recommended, and whether it happened from
the prosecution of this advice or not, is very immaterial,
but after no great lapse of time, a Prebendal
stall in the Cathedral Church of C. was obtained,
of which by the way his Lordship still retained
possession, even after he had succeeded to the
title, and to the very noble provision bestowed by a
generous and grateful nation duly to support its
honour.</p>

<p>Here let us pause. Providence, in such cases
as this before us, as indeed in every other, (for it
is impiety to call it fortune) holds the balance of
good and evil with an equal hand. The noble
Lord of whom we are speaking, lost a darling son
in the flower of youth, and as it has been said of
the most promising endowments—the branch is
broken from his hands. The dignity and accompanying
opulence will be vested in the heirs male<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
of a sister. This also may fail, but the name will
live for ever.</p>

<p>In the former periods of British history, the elevation
of great merchants, and of wealthy commercial
men, to the dignity of the Peerage, was
not unfrequent. Pennant, in his History of London,
mentions many noble families of this description.
That of the Duke of Leeds, for example,
of Coventry, of Essex, and of a great many others.
But in more modern times, wealth instead of accumulating
in the persons of a few fortunate individuals,
has been more equally as well as, more generally
diffused. The examples accordingly of
elevation to the honours of nobility from the city
have less frequently occurred.</p>

<p>Of the few which we have witnessed, perhaps
the house of Thellusson is that which may, with
the greatest propriety and justice, be classed among
those, whose origin was as humble as their present
condition is illustrious. Prosperity is hard to
bear, and honours not hereditary are apt for a time
to sit awkwardly on the wearer.</p>

<p>“And then to have the humour of state, and
after a demure travel of regard, telling them I
know my place, as I would they should do theirs,
to ask for my kinsman Toby. Seven of my people,
with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown
the while, and perchance wind up my watch, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
play with some rich jewel. Toby approaches,
curtsies there to me. I extend my hand to him
thus—quenching my familiar smile with an austere
regard of controul.”</p>

<p>It cannot but excite a smile to learn, that the
first new fangled Baron of R. having purchased the
mansion of a nobleman, which was one of those denominated
by our French neighbours, “entre Cour
et Jardin,” consecrated the “Cour” with great solemnity.
No carriages were permitted to enter its
mighty gates, except those of our brethren of noble
rank, or such as were stamped with bearings and
quarterings from the Herald’s College. The gates
were Taboo to the more mean and vulgar visitors,
whose finances compelled them to avail themselves
of the accommodation of hackneys.</p>

<p>The noble Baron, after a while, changed the
place of his abode, and his mansion was purchased
by one of the Royal Family. The Prince, with
more good sense, and with more consideration for
the feelings of his countrymen, directed the ponderous
gates to move on their hinges, as well for
the humble ensign, as for the greatest and proudest
of the realm.</p>

<p>One act of modesty, however, on the part of the
first Baron, ought to be recorded, and this is the
motto which he adopted for his arms:—</p>

<p class="center">Labore et honore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>The next individual in our manuscript who was
elevated to the Peerage, from the midst of commercial
connections and pursuits, was of a very highly
respectable, and ancient Dutch family. They
came to England more than a century ago, and
very honourably and very successfully engaged in
commerce. So early as the year 1751, one of
them was created a Baronet, with the title of Sir
Joshua Vanneck. The third Baronet in succession
was in the year 1796 raised to the rank of
Baron H.</p>

<p>The next personage of this description exhibits
perhaps the detached and solitary example of the
elevation of one of the tribe of Judah to the honours
of the British Peerage. Let it not be imagined that
any imputation or disparagement is intended by
this observation on the individuals of the family
thus illustriously distinguished. Far otherwise—are
we not all brethren? but the circumstance is
without parallel.</p>

<p>The family name of Gideon was discreetly laid
aside by the first Baron, and that of Eardley assumed,
the then Sir Sampson having married a
daughter of Sir John Eardley Wilmot, Lord Chief
Justice, descended in the female line from the ancient
family of Eardley.</p>

<p>The last individual whom we shall mention
of the above description, was the intimate friend
of Mr. Pitt, and in every particular deserving of
the honours which were bestowed upon him. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
is Lord ⸺, whose ancestors were all long and
successfully engaged in the banking business, and
in other departments of commerce.</p>

<p>There are or were many other individuals of this
family, all of whom rose not only to affluence, but
to considerable distinction in society. Two of these
were representatives of populous places in the House
of Commons; all were respected and esteemed for
their irreproachable conduct in life, and eminent
for their liberality, benevolence, and courtesy.</p>

<p>Such results of talents and diligence, honourably
and successfully exercised, excite the wish that
they might be enjoyed without interruption.</p>

<p>The names of several Bishops next occur, forming
a separate class of those, who, whatever they
are, or may have been, certainly exhibit examples
of individuals whose ultimate success in life was
disproportionate to their first expectations on entering
the great theatre of the world.</p>

<p>The fair and reasonable presumption is, in the
clerical profession, as in that of the law—certain
offices must be filled, to which it is natural to suppose
that the most eligible will be appointed. Moreover,
the longer the catalogue may happen to be,
of ecclesiastics who have risen to the most exalted
stations from humble beginnings, the stronger
the argument will be, to disprove the assertion generally
made, and too universally believed, that
such stations are only to be obtained by political
interest or intrigue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>Of these distinguished personages, many have
before been more or less circumstantially mentioned.
The following is merely a sort of recapitulation,
bearing upon the single point of extraordinary success
in the procurement of worldly honours.</p>

<p>The circumstances and causes which led to the
elevation of the late venerable Archbishop Moore,
are too well known to require repetition, and the
dignity which he obtained was too well merited to
excite discontent, or provoke invidious remark. His
Grace’s ultimate station in life must however far,
very far, have exceeded his most sanguine expectations,
when first entering the world.</p>

<p>The honours also of the excellent Bishop Porteus,
however well deserved and beneficially exercised,
beyond doubt, much exceeded all the possible calculations
and hopes of his early life. The successes
of such an individual command the greater admiration,
because they were not obtained by any interposition
of the great, by any political connection,
or indeed by the exertion of interest of any kind.
They were the result of a zealous, pious, uninterrupted
attention to the general duties of his profession,
with a particular regard to those of the stations,
which he immediately filled. He may nevertheless,
with strict propriety, be introduced in the
class of those, who have eminently been distinguished
by good fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>The Bishop of L. has been already spoken of,
and in terms with which it is hoped his Lordship
will express no dissatisfaction. He surely can
have no reluctance to confess, that his name is not
improperly inserted in this catalogue.</p>

<p>This may be no unsuitable place to insert a whimsical
anecdote of his Lordship, which though of a
humble and indeed insignificant denomination, may
surely be called a fortunate incident.</p>

<p>Some time after his Lordship had been appointed
to the Deanery of the Metropolitan Church, he retained
his confidential situation about the person of
Mr. Pitt, and regularly every morning attended the
minister in Downing-street, when in residence at
St. Paul’s. Returning one evening from Westminster
to the city, he somewhere at the bottom of
the Strand pulled out his handkerchief, and with
it, as afterwards appeared, his purse. He heard
it fall, and remarked the spot, but his natural
shortness of sight, added to the darkness of the
evening, prevented his finding it. On his walking
the next morning to Westminster, his Lordship
paused at the place where the accident had happened
the night before, and actually saw his purse,
which had just slipped off the curb-stone, and
probably had been overlooked by ten thousand
passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>The two next examples of good fortune going as
it were hand in hand with merit universally allowed,
reflect the highest honour upon Lord Sidmouth,
who was Prime Minister at the time. It is indeed
no more than an act of candour and justice to this
noble Lord, to acknowledge, that during the whole
period of his enjoyment of power, short indeed,
but in this at least memorable, the ecclesiastical
offices in the appointment of the Crown, were well
and honourably filled by individuals, whose sole recommendations
were their learning, their piety, and
their virtue: of which these two persons about to
be mentioned, were conspicuous examples.</p>

<p>The first of these excellent men was Bishop H.
who had for a long series of years honourably and
usefully distinguished himself in a great seminary,
by superintending the morals and the education of
youth.</p>

<p>He was ever remarkable for his sound learning,
and his conscientious, firm, and consistent discharge
of all his duties. It is therefore hardly necessary
to add, that his appointment to this high office, diffused
universal satisfaction among all the true friends
of the church.</p>

<p>The next appointment of the kind is entitled to
the same language of panegyric, whether we consider
the discernment and disinterested generosity
of the patron, or the great and various merits of
the person promoted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>Bishop B. was of respectable though humble
origin, but was distinguished, at a very early period,
both for his love of learning, and his success
in the pursuit of it.</p>

<p>His accomplishments, added to his most truly
irreproachable conduct, soon recommended him to
his superiors. Few names stood higher in the estimation
of scholars, and he was also classed among
the ablest and most zealous vindicators of our
Church establishment, at a perilous period, when
it was in danger of being undermined by false brethren
from within, as well as threatened by formidable
enemies from without. His promotion was of
course hailed by all, as an auspicious omen of the
intention of the Minister, to render the Episcopal
Bench venerable for its piety, admired for its talents,
and respected for its erudition.</p>

<p>How Bishop B. has borne and exercised his faculties,
has been sufficiently observable. Upon this
subject there is neither occasion or opportunity
here to expatiate. It is enough to be able to appeal
to his exemplary conduct in his diocese, which,
from conscientious motives, he has again and again
refused to exchange for more lucrative situations, as
well as to numerous publications alike remarkable
for their learning and their piety.</p>

<p>The next Episcopal character who appears to
merit a distinguished place among the more successful
adventurers in life, is one who did not obtain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
this high station from his abilities, though of a superior
kind, nor from his literary productions,
though of these there are many in existence. He
obtained his promotion from the friendship of a
Minister, discerning, cautious, accurate, and above
all, strictly tenacious of the characters of those
whom he distinguished, and most strenuously resolute
in enforcing the rigid performance of all clerical
duties, by whom of course, his virtues must
have been known, and his merits approved.</p>

<p>The appointment did certainly at first, excite
some degree of surprize. The venerable Bishop of
Landaff, on being informed of the event, was with
difficulty prevailed upon to believe it; but perhaps
there was an old grudge, which on this occasion
darted like a spectre on his recollection. There is,
however, neither the intention nor the desire to discuss
in this place either the merit of the receiver, or
the sagacity of the giver, of these honours; leave
therefore is respectfully taken of them both, with
the simple remark, that Bishop ⸺ was certainly
very, very fortunate.</p>

<p>The elevation of those to the higher offices of
the church, who have been employed for a series of
years in superintending the education of the sons
of our nobility, is honourable to all parties concerned,
and excites neither envy nor surprize. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
implies on one side a consistent, vigilant, and
unvaried attention to the duties imposed and undertaken,
and on the other, a correspondent sense of
services received, an acknowledgment of merit,
and a determination to reward it.</p>

<p>Many are the amiable and excellent individuals
who, by pursuing this path, have arrived at the
most exalted honours of the profession, which they
have subsequently adorned by their virtues.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, whoever they may be, or may
have been, all who have thus risen to greatness,
may, with the strictest propriety, be denominated
fortunate. Patrons sometimes either pay the tribute
of mortality, or lose their political influence,
which in our country often changes hands, before
the opportunity presents itself, of rewarding the
virtues they have tried and approved. Differences
of opinion may also eventually arise, some
“lis de tribus capellis” may intervene, abruptly
to dissolve connections, which in their origin
afforded the strongest presumptions of hope and
advantage.</p>

<p>The persons of the description to which the above
remarks allude, were the bishops of E. and L. the
first of whom owed his elevation to the noble family
of R. and the latter to that of A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>About twenty years since, it was a sort of fashionable
amusement among scholars, to translate the
popular Elegy of Gray in a Country Church yard,
into Greek. There were some critics who doubted
whether this admirable composition was calculated
to make its appearance in a Grecian dress; nevertheless,
the former of these Prelates was one of the
more successful adventurers, and he dedicated his
translation to the Duke of R. who was at that time
become a member of the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Of the latter Prelate, the Sexagenarian appears
to have had very little knowledge.</p>

<p>We have now to cross the water, where we shall
find some illustrious members of the Episcopal
Bench, who cannot reasonably be offended at
being classed among the favourites of fortune. But
it is time to end this chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>Ut enim in corporibus magnæ dissimilitudines sunt,
alios enim videmus velocitate ad cursum, alios viribus ad
luctandum valere, itemque in formis, aliis dignitatem inesse,
aliis venustatem, sic in animis exsistunt etiam majores
varietates.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

</div>

<p>Our first attention must necessarily be directed
to the Bishop of ⸺.</p>

<p>The ancestors and family connections of this
learned and accomplished prelate, were of the Roman
Catholic persuasion, and rigidly attached to
those tenets. His Lordship was himself educated
in them, and if we are not misinformed, actually
studied in the college at St. Omer’s, with the intention
of becoming a priest.</p>

<p>It happened, at least so our Brief instructs us,
that whilst in this situation, his vivacity and parts
attracted the notice of a near connection of the
late Duke of ⸺, and that on his expostulation,
and promises of protection and assistance,
young ⸺ was without much difficulty prevailed
upon to read his recantation, and become a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
member and a clergyman of our Protestant communion.</p>

<p>He came over to this country, and accompanied
his patron to Ireland, but during his Grace’s administration,
it does not appear that any preferment
became vacant, becoming the patron to bestow, or
the client to accept. He nevertheless availed himself
of this interval to ingratiate himself more effectually
with his patron, to whom he was enabled to
render various services by the skilfulness and dexterity
of his pen. He returned to England with
the Duke, through whose good offices he was, after
no great lapse of time, appointed to valuable preferment
in some of the northern provinces. This
however not exactly suiting him, he, through the
same channel of interest, obtained an exchange for
a valuable benefice in Ireland, upon which he fixed
his residence.</p>

<p>When Lord Fitzwilliam, the great friend of the
Duke of P. was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
Dr. ⸺ was admitted to the same sort of confidence
as he had enjoyed with his predecessor; and
short as the residence of Lord F. was in his exalted
station, a Bishopric became vacant, to which the
Doctor was appointed.</p>

<p>It is but rendering him strict justice to say, that
from the moment of his entering upon his functions,
he discharged them invariably, with great usefulness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
and honour. He has been rather considered as
too severe a disciplinarian, and a proposition which
he made to his diocese, to attend quarterly lectures
on the Greek Testament at the palace, excited much
murmuring and discontent.</p>

<p>When translated to the more extensive and more
valuable See of ⸺ he exercised the same vigilance,
among other examples of which, the following
anecdote is related.</p>

<p>A young dashing clergyman of high connections,
who had a curacy in the diocese, did not think it
important to be particularly rigid and punctual in
the discharge of his duty, but was too easily detained
by the allurements and blandishments of
Dublin, from his too indulgent parishioners. This
at length reached his Lordship’s ears, who determined
to ascertain the fact himself.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on a Sunday, he proceeded to the
church, where he heard no bell knolling to church,
saw no parishioners chatting in the porch, nor any
preparation for divine service. With some difficulty
the clerk was found, to whom his Lordship
was known.</p>

<p>“Why is there no preparation for divine service?”
asked the Bishop. “My Lord,” said the
clerk, “our young master has not been among us
this fortnight.” “Ring the bell immediately,”
said the Bishop. Upon this a congregation was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
soon assembled, to whom his Lordship read prayers,
and preached.</p>

<p>The Bishop presumed that intelligence of this
matter would be communicated to the defaulting
curate, but he nevertheless chose to make a second
experiment of the kind, and on the following Sunday
repeated his visit to the same village. Here
he found things precisely as before—no bell knolled
to church—no peasants sitting on the grave-stones—no
visible signs of population. The Bishop a second
time sent for the clerk, assembled the congregation,
and performed the duty as before.</p>

<p>It does not however appear, that he was again
obliged to repeat his visit, and the shame and consternation
of the curate, on finding who had been
his substitute, may be easily imagined.</p>

<p>The Bishop had a sister, a very rigid Roman
Catholic, who remained immoveably fixed in her
religious tenets. She had, however, a son, who
was prevailed upon to accept of an Archdeaconry,
and other preferment, to the amount of almost
two thousand a-year. An uncle also and a brother
were frequent visitors at the palace, who nevertheless
resisted all importunity to change their
religious creed, although accompanied by assurances
of the greatest temporal advantages.</p>

<p>All circumstances being dispassionately weighed,
no apology seems necessary to be made for introducing
the above distinguished personage in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
class of those who may be denominated “fortunate.”</p>

<p>Not less so, perhaps, was the Bishop of ⸺.
This prelate’s<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> name is ⸺. In
his earlier life, he officiated as private tutor in
some distinguished family, which he left, however,
with some abruptness. It is by no means
to his dishonour, that his origin was very humble,
but he was invariably remarkable for his elegant
appearance, and truly engaging manners.
Not succeeding in his profession at home, he
resolved to try his fortune abroad, and accordingly,
in the beginning of the American contest,
accompanied Lord Cornwallis to that country as
an army chaplain.</p>

<p>In America he obtained an introduction to Lord
⸺, a friend of whose he married, and to this
connection he was unquestionably indebted for his
subsequent elevation in life.</p>

<p>This Prelate, like the foregoing, was educated in
the strictest principles of the Roman Catholic persuasion.</p>

<p>Dr. F. Bishop of ⸺, was son to the Archbishop
of Dublin, who himself might be introduced
in the class of the more fortunate, being of very
humble origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>The B⸺p of ⸺ had formed a connection
with a scyon of a noble house, whom nevertheless
his father, the Archbishop, did not approve, and
accordingly refused his consent to the marriage.
The son was at that time Archdeacon of Dublin,
and persevering in his determination to marry the
lady, had the banns published in his own church.
The report was circulated, that his Grace resolved
to attend, and forbid the banns, on the third time
of their publication. The novelty of the circumstance
produced so great a crowd, that there was
hardly standing room in the church. The incident,
however, did not take place, and the parties were
in due time married.</p>

<p>The Bishop of ⸺ was promoted to his
high dignity by Lord C⸺n, to whom he had
formerly been private tutor. Lord C. had invited
Dr. Powis, Dean of Canterbury, to accompany him
to Ireland. On his declining it, his Lordship
made the same offer to Dr. B⸺r, which was
accepted.</p>

<p>The Primate of Ireland was brother to the late
learned and excellent Bishop of St. Asaph, and was
elevated to that station by Lord B⸺.</p>

<p>The excellent and very learned Bishop of C.
was the tutor of Emanuel College when Lord Westmoreland
resided there, and was his Lordship’s
private tutor also. He had previously received his
education at Harrow, and was in every respect a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
very learned and accomplished man. When Lord
W. was appointed to the Lord Lieutenancy of
Ireland, he necessarily remembered his old preceptor
and friend. He was accordingly, on the
first opportunity, appointed to the Bishopric of
C⸺k, and afterwards to the more lucrative see
of C⸺e.</p>

<p>Whoever knew this amiable prelate in his early
life, or have been honoured by his friendship in his
progress to his present dignity, cannot but experience
the truest satisfaction, from seeing the benefits
of fortune so honourably bestowed, and so
discreetly enjoyed.</p>

<p>The majority of the Episcopal Bench in our sister
country, is composed of the younger branches of
the more illustrious families. Such as, for example,
Elphin, Derry, Kilmore, Down and Connor, Waterford,
Kildare, Killaloe, Raphoe, Cork and Ross,
Fernes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Clonfert is or was a gentleman
of the name of Butson, of whom the only memorandum
in our notes, intimates, that he was in early
life one of the under masters of Winchester school.
Beyond all doubt indebted for his promotion to his
conduct and learning. He was educated at Oxford,
and was the author of a very fine poem on the Love
of our Country, which in 1772 obtained a prize at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
that University.</p>

<p>With the above names, the catalogue of those
prelates, who may without impropriety be denominated
fortunate, concludes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

</div>

<p>No order of precedence or regard to dates is observed
in the Memoranda which succeed. Many
of the individuals here brought before the reader,
have before been introduced. They are now collected
in the class of those personally known to the
Sexagenarian, the termination of whose career
seems to have been far more auspicious and fortunate
than their origin, connections, and first introduction
into life, promised.</p>

<p>The first is a worthy Baronet. He has himself
an honest and manly pride in acknowledging, that
his present distinction in life, his great opulence,
and extensive influence, is imputable alone to his
determined perseverance in industrious pursuits.</p>

<p>He was educated in the medical line, and in that
capacity proceeded to India, either there professionally
to establish himself, or he might perhaps have
been a surgeon in a King’s ship, or in an East<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
Indiaman. This is not material. He by some means
or other, most probably by some commercial speculation,
obtained possession of a very large quantity
of opium. He disposed of this, and as is believed,
in China, to such extraordinary advantage, that it
produced a capital, on which he built his future
fortunes, and those of his house.</p>

<p>This house is of no ordinary dimensions. There
are at least twenty immediate descendants from
him, all of whom have been successively introduced
into the path which leads to fortune, not
only with liberality but splendour.</p>

<p>He himself is a Baronet. His commercial engagements
and concerns extend to every quarter
of the globe. His two eldest sons are in Parliament,
and fill the highest stations at the Bank and
the East India-house. The rest of his family are in
situations of the greatest respectability. Although
this gentleman may very properly be ranked in the
very first class of successful adventurers in life, yet
he bears his faculties meekly, and does not, as in
similar instances is too frequently the case, manifest
the insolence of wealth.</p>

<p>The next personage who claims a high place
among those who have drawn a capital prize in the
lottery of life, has his portrait delineated in a former
part of the work. His entrance into life was,
as the son of a clergymen, respectable, but of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span> no
considerable eminence, and his claims did not rise
beyond what the exertion of moderate talents might
promise by persevering diligence at the bar. At
the termination of life, he found himself, in consequence
of a most fortunate marriage, a Member of
Parliament, a considerable landholder, of extensive
influence, and a companion of the great and powerful.
This is the individual who, in his progress
from mediocrity to affluence, had the misfortune
to lose his memory.</p>

<p>A third distinguished character, from a very
humble origin, and circumscribed education, after
various experiments and vicissitudes, all at once
found himself, if not to his own surprize, certainly
to that of many, a Member of Parliament, and in
a situation of great emolument, and of high responsibility.
His original connections were indeed
humble, if a certain lively lady may be credited,
whose unembarrassed assurance, night after night,
considerably baffled and perplexed the wisest and
the gravest Members of Parliament. But so far
his subsequent elevation does him the greater honour.
Without any pretensions to learning, he
possessed respectable talents and extensive accomplishments.
He was a fluent speaker, and enjoyed
that characteristic self-confidence, which neither
could be disconcerted by the opposition, nor dismayed
by the numbers of his adversaries in debate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
He certainly was an elegant poet, and produced
a poem in commemoration of a splendid victory,
which was exceedingly popular.</p>

<p>In one respect, he was, by universal consent, remarkably
successful. He was a member of various
Symposiums, the principal object of whose assembling
was to have good talk. He never failed to
have it all to himself.</p>

<p>Fortune, who makes a lottery of life, has seldom
exhibited greater waywardness than in the personage
whose portrait next appears. He was an Irishman,
of little or no hereditary property, but well educated,
handsome in his person, and agreeable in
his manners. He was, it is believed, called to the
bar, but whether he ever practised is uncertain,
and of no consequence. The place of his practice,
when known to the Sexagenarian, was certainly not
at the bar. He came over to this country, it may
be said, without any intended reflection, to seek his
fortune.</p>

<p>In his progress, he caught the contagion of play,
but at that period, in all probability, his stake could
not be high, nor the risk which he encountered
great. It was the pernicious principle and habit
which was to be reprobated. Most fortunately,
for so the result might eventually have proved,
he met a young lady at a fashionable watering-place,
who attracted his immediate and serious
attention. And well she might, for the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>sun of
Britain has hardly ever shone upon a lovelier
object. Most agreeable in her person, most captivating
in her manners, of an intellect very far
superior to the generality of her sex, with a high
principle of honour, warm-hearted, generous, every
thing indeed for which man could wish. Add to
all this, a circumstance probably neither undesireable,
nor entirely overlooked by our gentleman, she
had a very large fortune, and was entirely at her
own disposal.</p>

<p>He succeeded in his addresses. The lady treated
him with a generous candour; and although not
unacquainted with his characteristic foible, believed
in his solemn protestations of laying aside for ever
the dangerous propensities he had encouraged; and
not improbably also trusted, as well she might, in her
powers of enabling him to find the “Bathmendi<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,”
of which he was in search, at home, in the reciprocation
of connubial confidence and love.</p>

<p>Things went on very smoothly for a considerable
time. The lady’s good sense, discretion, and engaging
behaviour, appeared to have obtained a memorable
triumph. Old acquaintances were revived,
and cordially welcomed—new ones formed—the
sweet ties of children promised to cement and
perpetuate the harmony of the establishment;—when
suddenly a sort of restlessness appeared on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
the part of the gentleman, and his absence from
home, and particularly in the evening, became
more and more frequent. It is in no circumstances
whatever, an easy matter, to elude the vigilant and
anxious eyes of a mother and a wife; and the
lady of whom we are speaking, was remarkably
acute, discerning, and sagacious. She evidently
perceived that he had betaken himself to his old
haunts, and former companions. Remonstrance
she knew to be ineffectual, and she formed her plan
accordingly; which, though it could not be unattended
with severe mortification, she persisted in
with firmness.</p>

<p>She shut herself up with her children, bestowing
the whole of her time and attention on the care of
their health, the formation of their manners, and
the cultivation of their minds. She received not,
as heretofore, even the most intimate and the oldest
of her friends, wisely observing, that if the master
of the house were not present to bid welcome, the
feast would resemble that, in which Banquo’s chair
was empty.</p>

<p>The space of the theatre in which the hero of
the drama, subsequently exercised his talents, became
very considerably enlarged. He was seen by
the side of Princes, and Dukes, and Peers were
his companions. He was a Member of the British
Parliament, and inhabited a palace. He launched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
into all the luxuries of a depraved metropolis, and
seldom saw his almost widowed wife except at the
transient half hour of a two o’clock breakfast.</p>

<p>The reader will not be unmindful that our Memoranda
are still employed in brief communications
concerning certain individuals personally known to
the Sexagenarian, who, from the humblest beginnings,
have risen from the contingencies of life to
situations of affluence and honour. We come now
to a Right Honourable—Aye!—a Right, Right
Honourable!</p>

<p>His first origin could not possibly be very lofty,
though it is not pretended to assert what it was,
but his first appearance on the public stage was in
the navy, and in its civil department; probably as
captain’s clerk. That he should ascend to the
highest degree of the department, and in due time
become a purser, is in the natural order of things,
and necessarily implies steadiness and good conduct.
But the individual under review, had higher
and greater qualities; and the next record concerning
him, is the fact of his having entered into
the line of politics, bustling among the great and
powerful, and rendering himself serviceable to one
of the greatest ministers this country ever beheld,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
by his strong sense, sagacity, powers of computation,
and great expertness in all arithmetical calculations.</p>

<p>He became a Member of Parliament—forward,
prompt, and useful, wherever and whenever the
Minister required his assistance, which was principally
in matters relating to the business of the
Exchequer.</p>

<p>The value of his services was felt, acknowledged,
and rewarded—rewarded indeed to no common
extent. The advantages conferred at the time, and
the sinecures still retained, now that the giver is no
more, constitute no inconsiderable catalogue, and
render the possessor one of the richest and most
powerful of our English commoners. These benefits
also result to the various branches of his family,
who are all of them more or less distinguished by
situations of honour and emolument.</p>

<p>All intention of depreciating the sterling value of
the individual, whose portrait is here slightly delineated,
is pointedly disavowed, nor indeed are the
cursory remarks which are subjoined at all likely to
lessen his currency.</p>

<p>But our friend adds drily, that if a treatise
were to be elaborately written on “Memory,” and
the vicissitudes it undergoes, its degrees of strength
or weakness, as things turn out prosperous or adverse,
he thinks it will appear, that it is apt to grow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
progressively weaker and more uncertain in those,
whose elevation in life has exceeded their early
prospects and expectations, than in those who
have passed quietly and soberly along the middle
path, neither drawn aside by ambition, nor thrust
down by misfortune.</p>

<p>Whether there is any physical reason which will
account for this phœnomenon, it is not pretended
to conjecture; perhaps rapidity of ascent may have
some effect in confusing the intellect; perhaps glittering
scenes, constantly succeeded by still more
gaudy and fascinating spectacles, may dazzle the
imagination. Be this as it may, the gentleman
before us, certainly laboured under the suspicion of
being liable to this infirmity.</p>

<p>Indeed, with respect to him, there was some
aggravation in the circumstances, for it has been
said, that when he was most positive, and vehement,
and determined in his assertions, then it was
that his accuracy was most doubted.</p>

<p>One example occurred to our Sexagenarian of
this great man’s being occasionally at least, subject
to this infirmity, and he has recorded it.</p>

<p>He made our friend, it seems, a promise positive
and unequivocal, clogged by no qualifications, and
subject to no incidental occurrences. Alas! a walk
of about two miles dispelled every trace of the
fabric in his mind, nor did any image of it ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
again appear to present itself to his recollection.
Honest pride prevented his being reminded of it
by the individual concerned, and so the matter
passed away; indeed so effectually, that the great
man, at a subsequent period of no great distance,
had no remembrance even of the person of him,
whose hopes had been so agreeably, but so unfortunately
raised, only to be disappointed.</p>

<p>The next personage who became of very great
consequence from the meanest origin, and whose
fall was not less extraordinary than his rise, was
neither Right Honourable nor Honourable, but he
did arrive at the distinction of knighthood, and probably
had yet higher titles in contemplation.</p>

<p>His first appearance was as a common shop-boy
to a retail grocer. He remained in this situation
for some years. Whilst in this employment, he
scraped an acquaintance with the niece of a decent
man, who kept a respectable inn in a provincial
town. Allured by the encouragement of his dulcinea,
and probably with the prospect of ultimately
bettering himself, he became a waiter at this inn.
He finally married the niece, became master of the
inn, and inherited from his wife considerable property.</p>

<p>He was a man of weak and confused intellect,
and indeed could but just read and write, yet he
had a great deal of low cunning and sagacity, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
first suggested to his uncle by marriage, the idea of
establishing a Bank. This was accordingly accomplished,
and on the death of the first proprietor, was
successfully, and for a very extended period, carried
on by the person whose portrait is here delineated.</p>

<p>Among his other qualities, he had all the pliancy
and obsequiousness to his superiors, which might
be expected from a tavern-waiter, and by some
means got an introduction to G. Earl of O. to
whom he made himself so useful, and so acceptable,
that through his influence he was made Receiver-General
of the County. The emoluments
and reputation of this office, were remarkably salutary
in propping up, which it did for years, the
reputation of his Bank; and, as it is generally
believed, enabled him to administer to the necessities
of his noble friend, who, in the interval of
his expecting remittances from Russia, in return
for one of the most valuable collection of pictures
ever formed in this country, was reduced to great
pecuniary difficulties.</p>

<p>At length the Bank stopped payment, and his
debts, including the claims of government upon
his house, amounted to 600,000<i>l.</i> It is very extraordinary,
that at this particular time, he had only
25,000<i>l.</i> of notes in circulation. It is no less singular,
that this failure did not occasion the bankruptcy,
or cause stoppage of payment, in any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
house. Among his principal creditors were gentlemen
who had made considerable deposits, but who,
by taking the concerns into their own hands, at a
most propitious period, when landed estates sold
at the very highest price, contrived to make a dividend
of fourteen shillings in the pound.</p>

<p>Luckily for the creditors, his son was made a
partner during the life of his father, or every
shilling of the landed property would have gone to
him.</p>

<p>When the father died, or what became of the
son, was unknown, but the family fell back again
to their original poverty.</p>

<p>A whimsical anecdote is recorded of the above
individual. When riches began to abound, he
must needs set up his carriage, and he applied to
the parson of the parish to furnish him with a
motto. This same person was a most eccentric character.
Very fond of his pipe—still more fond of his
bottle—but withal, was very learned, and had an
abundant store of facetiousness and humour. On
his wealthy friend’s application for a motto, he gave
him the following—“Quo mihi fortunam?”</p>

<p>This was accordingly placed upon the carriage;
but some of the banker’s half-learned friends pretended
to dispute its accuracy; upon which, out of
humour, he remonstrated with his clerical adviser
for imposing an incorrect motto upon him.—“Friend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Roger,” replied the old gentleman, “do
you support your carriage, and I’ll support the
motto.” The motto is indeed remarkable for the
seeming spirit of prophecy with which it was communicated.
The motto survives—the coach is no
more.</p>

<p>The next two individuals, concerning whom notices
present themselves, were of the ecclesiastical
profession, and both may surely be denominated
fortunate.</p>

<p>The one was in the humblest possible situation,
compatible with the character of a student, in one
of the colleges of Oxford, but he carried with him
the best qualifications of steadiness of principle,
thirst for knowledge, and the seeds of an honourable
ambition.</p>

<p>On his first leaving the University, no better
occupation presented itself than that of a humble
curacy in a country village. But here fortune befriended
him. Among his auditors was a venerable
nobleman, who had himself risen to his wealth and
dignities from no very splendid beginnings, by the
active use of considerable talents, and who consequently
had the sagacity to distinguish merit,
and, as it appeared from the consequences, had,
also the liberality to assist and reward it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>This nobleman having received the young curate
into his familiar acquaintance, soon discovered that
he had talents of the higher order, and which merited
a more spacious held for their display and exercise.
A very long period did not elapse, before a living
of considerable value, with no small degree of responsibility
attached to it, was procured by the
nobleman for his friend.</p>

<p>In the discharge of this greater duty, he so well
acquitted himself, that ere long, a Prebendal stall
was added to it, and at no very great interval of
time, he became a Dean, Bishop, perhaps hereafter ⸺</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that this advancement to
high ecclesiastical dignities, was the mere result of
noble and powerful influence. In addition to private
virtues and personal recommendations, claims
to preferment were enforced by various and profound
erudition exercised on professional subjects.</p>

<p>His first publication, if we mistake not, was
some ingenious and learned discourses, preached
at his own parish church, containing the arguments
for and against the reception of Christianity by the
ancient Jews and Greeks.</p>

<p>He also preached a very powerful sermon, which
he subsequently published, on the Claims of the
Establishment, in reply to the loud expostulations
every where circulated, on what were denominated
the Claims of the Roman Catholics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>But this personage’s great work was a volume of
Dissertations or Lectures, the subject of which was
a comparison between Paganism and Christianity.
They were obviously intended for the benefit of a
great public seminary, to which among other things it
had been objected, that more was taught the pupils,
of Heathen, than of Christian theology. The
avowed object of the work was to illustrate the
Christian Religion, and explain the errors and follies
of Heathen superstition, and it is really a
powerful production.</p>

<p>The other successful candidate for clerical honours
arrived at equal dignities, but with claims
very dissimilar. He was a servitor at one of our
universities, and though of remarkable steadiness
and unimpeachable conduct, discovered no talents
which justified his expectation of college distinctions.</p>

<p>He accordingly took orders, and went to a village
remote from the metropolis, to discharge the
honourable and useful office of a curate. Here
fortune befriended him also. A noble family had
a mansion in the vicinity, the head of which laboured
under a sort of imbecility, which disqualified him
for active business.</p>

<p>The curate, if respectable, always receives more
or less notice from the heads of a parish, and in
this instance Mr. G. was found so attentive, obliging,
and assiduous, that great intimacy and confidence
followed. There was also a General election, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
event of which the family greatly interested themselves,
and the curate, by his zeal, activity, and ardour,
was very instrumental in procuring the matter
to terminate, as his patrons desired.</p>

<p>The first bonus received in testimony of their
attachment, was the living of the place where he
had officiated as curate, which was worth little less
than twelve hundred pounds a-year. But this was
far from all. The intimacy was increased on one
side, as the usefulness was experienced on the
other; and as the political influence of the family
was very considerable, one of the best Prebendal
stalls in the kingdom was added to the
Rectory, and at no very great distance of time, a
Deanery. But here an act of justice remains to
be done.</p>

<p>This ecclesiastical friend of the Sexagenarian,
though not a man remarkable for his learning, his
talents, or his accomplishments, was eminently so,
for his mild and amiable manners. His memory
does not deserve to be followed with scorn or disdain,
because he owed his elevation to a concurrence
of fortuitous and fortunate circumstances.
Rather let it receive the tribute of respect which it
merits, from his being, which he really was, friendly,
benevolent, charitable, and zealously anxious to
promote the comforts and improve the interests of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
his poor and dependent neighbours.</p>

<p>A third clerical personage may not improperly
be introduced among those, whose progressive success
in life far surpassed their earlier claims and
expectations. His history is succinctly this.</p>

<p>He was the son of a country tradesman, who
was sufficiently opulent to give his two sons a
University education. The elder became a Bishop,
and well merited, as he has honourably exercised,
that exalted office. The younger son had always
infirm health, with the reputation, however, of considerable
talents. Of these, indeed, no specimen
has been placed before the public for their
animadversion, but he has pursued through life,
the noiseless easy tenor of his way, enjoying the
good things of this world in no very limited proportion.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical preferment was poured thickly
upon him. The brother truly acted a brother’s
part. He might have been Fellow of his College,
and in due course, after a long series of years,
might have succeeded to a College living. More
fortunately for him, high and lucrative situations
were ready for his acceptance, almost as soon as
he was able to sustain them. But this ought not
to excite either envy or regret in contemporaries,
who have not met with so favourable a tide in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
affairs. He bears his faculties meekly, and his life
is irreproachable.</p>

<p>This catalogue is continued much further, but
the above examples may perhaps be thought sufficient,
and it really appears to be expedient to think
of shutting our tablets.</p>

<p>We will, however, venture to subjoin a brief
account of another clerical person, who arrived at
equal dignities from a very humble beginning.</p>

<p>On leaving college, he accepted of the situation
of assistant teacher in a great public seminary.
Here he continued steady and attentive to his employment
for a considerable number of years, rather
remarkable for his engaging and agreeable
person and manners, than for splendour of talents,
or depth of erudition. Indeed he has never appeared
before the public as an author, except by
the printing of a very few sermons, of which local
circumstances required the publication.</p>

<p>His first successful advance towards affluence was
by an auspicious marriage with a person who inherited
considerable property, but he had long been
quietly yet effectually obtaining reputation as a
preacher at one of our popular charities.</p>

<p>He received his first reward for his excellence in
this branch of his profession, from a private individual.
A lady of rank and fortune bestowed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
benefice of some value upon him, unsolicited and
unexpected on his part, solely from the favourable
impression which his talents as a preacher had
made upon her.</p>

<p>His next piece of good fortune was alike unexpected,
but still more highly to his honour. One
of the most lucrative, and one of the most honourable,
pieces of preferment in the metropolis, in the
gift of the Diocesan, became vacant, and which had
always been held by individuals of high character
and pretensions.</p>

<p>Great interest was of course made to obtain this
appointment; and it was reported and believed,
that Royalty itself interposed, under circumstances
which, in some degree, might be supposed to justify
such interposition. It proved, however, ineffectual;
and the Bishop, influenced by no other motive than
the desire of having a zealous, active, conscientious
Pastor in a very large and populous parish, wrote
to the individual, the subject of this notice, and
with no personal knowledge of him, and without
any other recommendation than that of his professional
character, offered the living to his acceptance.
It was of course accepted, and the good and pious
intentions of the Bishop were adequately fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>His good fortune, however, did not stop here.
The character he had established was confirmed,
the reputation of his professional excellence was
extended, and finally, he rendered himself so acceptable
to those who have it in their influence to
obtain, or in their power to confer, ecclesiastical
dignities, that a valuable Deanery was given; and
it has indeed further been reported, that if it had
been agreeable to his views and wishes, he might
have obtained still higher honours.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

</div>

<p>Detached from every other part of the Recollections,
the following anecdote appears by itself,
and as it seems to have been communicated from
the very highest authority, may be recorded more
particularly, as its authenticity may be easily ascertained.</p>

<p>In the year 1720, celebrated for the bursting of
the South Sea bubble, a gentleman called late in
the evening at the banking-house of Messrs. Hankies
and Co. He was in a coach, but refused to
get out, and desired that one of the partners of the
house would come to him. Having ascertained that
it was really one of the principals, and not a clerk,
who appeared, he put into his hands a parcel, very
carefully sealed up and protected, and desired that
it might be laid on one side till he should call again,
which would be in the course of a very few days.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
A few days passed away—a few weeks did the same,
and indeed some months also, but the stranger returned
no more.</p>

<p>At the end of the second or third year, the partners
agreed to open this mysterious parcel in the
presence of each other. They found it to contain
thirty thousand pounds, with a letter, stating that it
was obtained by the South Sea speculation, and
directing that it should now be vested in the
hands of three trustees, whose names were given,
and the interest appropriated to the relief of the
poor.</p>

<p>What particular class of poor—whether the poor
of London, or of Westminster, or the poor sufferers
by the bubble, was not specified, and the vagueness
of the instructions rendered the matter extremely
perplexing. Under this difficulty, the
partners or the trustees very properly applied to
the Lord Mayor, and to the law officers of the
crown. If we are correct, Sir Dudley Ryder was
Attorney-General at the time. It was agreed, that
the capital should be vested in the names of the
Lord Mayor, Recorder, and Attorney-General, for
the time being and to come, and that each of the
three gentlemen nominated by the stranger as
trustees, should have the interest of ten thousand
pounds, to be distributed at his discretion for the
use of the poor. The stranger was never heard of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
afterwards.</p>

<p>One of the trustees was a gentleman of Norfolk,
whose family was well known to the Sexagenarian.
During his life, he had a room fitted up with cases,
shelves, drawers, &amp;c. which was called the Poors’
Room, and where coats, waistcoats, shirts, shifts,
shoes, blankets, &amp;c. were deposited for the use of
proper applicants. The effect of this for the time,
was the total annihilation of the poor rates in the
particular parish where this trustee resided.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>Paucos enim qui sunt eminentissimi excerpere in animo
est, facile est autem studiosis, qui sint his simillimi judicare,
ne quisquam queratur omissos forte aliquos eorum
quos ipse valde probet. Fateor enim plures legendos esse
quam qui a me nominabuntur.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

</div>

<p>If the Sexagenarian was not personally acquainted
with all the learned men and wits of his time, it will
already have appeared that he was more or less familiarly
known to a great many.</p>

<p>A considerable list is still to be found of literary
characters, scattered among the Memoranda, some
of whom are designated by their real names, whilst
others are only to be discovered from their portraits.
As it may afford matter of amusement to many
readers to exercise conjecture, a select number of
authors is subjoined, certainly delineated from the
life, as all were personally known to the artist who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
has represented their lineaments.</p>

<p>Our notations commence with honest, but unfortunate
John ⸺. His original designation and
employment was that of a watchmaker, but his
natural propensities inclined him to a love of letters
and the arts, and he certainly discovered considerable
taste for both. It is to be feared, and perhaps
on his account to be lamented, that when he should
have been investigating improvements in mechanics,
he was to be found studying criticisms on Shakespeare
with Henderson, or conversing about Salvator
Rosa with Mortimer.</p>

<p>This was certainly not the road to affluence, and
it was not a great while before he found that he had
lost his way, and got entangled in briars and thickets
beyond his skill and ability to remove. He withdrew
from his mechanical occupation, and was
compelled to exercise his ingenuity in a far less promising
and lucrative pursuit. He became first of
all, a writer in the newspapers; and here let the
pride of affluence forbear to express scorn and contempt
at this employment, as being mean, ignoble,
or disingenuous. Let such be informed, that it is
not the employment itself, but the spirit and the
motive with which it is undertaken and prosecuted,
which entitles it to approbation or censure. It may
be rendered, as it often has been, the vehicle of
moral instruction, of useful information, of agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
amusement. It has been pursued sometimes
as an amusement of leisure, and not unfrequently,
from the pressure of necessity, by some of the ablest
and some of the most amiable characters among
us.</p>

<p>The exercise of John’s abilities in this line, procured
him a scanty provision for himself, his wife,
and a sister. It is doing him an act of justice to
state, that he was no politician, and never dipped
his pen in the gall of party, or interfered with the
measures of government or the proceedings of any
opposition. His productions were perfectly harmless,
and chiefly consisted of anecdotes of the stage,
of pictures and artists, with such other matters as he
gleaned from an extensive range of acquaintance.
But he had also another resource, though this was
but an unsubstantial one also. He had a taste for
engraving, and a particular fondness for the works
of Hogarth, in which perhaps he was more skilfully
conversant than almost any other contemporary.
He had, if our information does not deceive us, a
slight knowledge of Hogarth himself, but after his
death, he became intimately acquainted with Mrs.
Hogarth. He was useful to the widow in assisting
in the disposal of Hogarth’s prints, and he learned
from her a great many particulars of the artist and
his works, which he afterwards turned to account.
It is this circumstance which entitles him to a place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
in the catalogue of authors.</p>

<p>Under the auspices of the Boydells, he published
a minute detail and description of all Hogarth’s
works, in three large volumes; a very agreeable
and amusing work, which was well received by the
public, and afterwards republished.</p>

<p>He was an amiable and unoffending man, and
there were many families, of which that of the Sexagenarian
was one, in which he was constantly received
with hospitality and kindness. He repaid
the welcome he found, by his lively conversation,
and abundance of anecdotes. Poor fellow! it is to
be feared, that in the decline of life, when his
powers of mind were too enfeebled to communicate
the usual pabulum of intelligence to his employers,
and when his bodily powers became too infirm to
go in quest of it, that he had to endure many and
serious privations.</p>

<p>The literary fund was not then established, or
his latter days might have been rendered more
comfortable. This admirable institution, as is very
well known, has frequently administered, in hours
of suffering and anguish, substantial consolation to
afflicted and expiring genius. It is to be hoped
that its powers may be yet further extended, and
that by timely interference the extreme of suffering
may be prevented, that talent may not be checked
in its ardent career from the want of aid and encouragement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
nor undertakings suffered to fall to the
ground, and be the cause of ruin to the original
contriver, merely from the want of oil to facilitate
the motion of the machine.</p>

<p>Where, or under what circumstances, the person
of whom we are speaking, paid the last debt of
nature, is not recorded, but this slight tribute seems
affectionately paid by our Sexagenarian to his memory.</p>

<p>Among the various incidents of his wayward
passage through life, he used to relate one which
appears worth commemorating. Whilst he exercised
his occupation of a watchmaker in Maiden-lane,
he was on some occasion or other in his shop
at a very early hour in the morning, expecting
any thing but a customer. An old man, of very
mean appearance as to dress and person, presented
himself, and desired to see one of the most valuable
watches in his possession, and one that without
any consideration of price, he could conscientiously
recommend. Our friend John happened
to have a repeater by him, made by one of the
first artists, and of the goodness of which he
thought very highly. This he accordingly produced.
The old man, after taking a few minutes
to examine it, enquired the price.—“Fifty guineas.”—“Is
that the lowest?”—“It is.” The
money was immediately paid, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span> the old gentleman,
on leaving the shop, gave his card of address.</p>

<p>He turned out to be the celebrated Mr. Elwes
of avaricious memory, and he frequently called
afterwards in Maiden-lane, to express his satisfaction
with his purchase.</p>

<p>“Many are the characters who pass through
the vale of life, who in their time contributed to the
improvement of society by their accomplishments,
rendered service to literature by their learning, and
enlivened and delighted numerous circles by their
wit, who have been suffered to pass away, as though
they had never been, without any memorial of their
talents, or their virtues. To plant one slip of myrtle
or of laurel round the graves of such, to rescue from
‘dumb forgetfulness’ even the few who have been
comprehended within the limited circle of our own
personal knowledge, cannot surely be deemed an
unamiable, nor altogether a useless office.”</p>

<p>With such an apostrophe, the Sexagenarian commences
the notes, which are here modified and curtailed,
of the individuals next introduced. Two of
the same name first present themselves—<i>sed valde
dissimiles</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>Both of them were highly estimable as men, desireable
as companions, accomplished and valuable
as authors, though in very different ways. One was
facetiousness and good humour personified, the
other was grave and saturnine: the conversation of
the one was full of vivacity and mirth-inspiring
anecdote, animated by much reading and extensive
knowledge of the world; the other instructed his
hearers by his diversified knowledge, which he
readily communicated, and although there were
some “pursuers of literature,” who affected to ridicule
his talents, no insinuation could be more injurious
or false. Even on the very subject which
provoked the aspersions of the satirist, sounder
critics allowed that he had the best end of the staff.
He got the better of an adversary elated with popular
favour, presumed to be at the head of one
particular branch of criticism, in which indeed he
had spent a long and laborious life.</p>

<p>The publications of these two namesakes, as
might be imagined, were alike different. One was
a very entertaining and instructive essayist, a most
skilful and accomplished biographer, an editor of
various popular works, in which office he evinced a
perfect knowledge of our language in all its stages
from barbarity to refinement, great sagacity, sound
judgment, and a cultivated taste. But neither did
he escape the merciless rage of critics. What author
can expect it? Who that writes a book may not at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
the same time exclaim,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ut quidem Hercle in medium hodie processerim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Væ illis Virgis miseris quæ hodie in tergo morientur meo.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But however the critic might gratify some latent
spleen, the author’s reputation did not in the smallest
degree suffer, nor was his zeal diminished.
When the Sexagenarian retired from the world, he
left his friend in the plenitude of honest fame, successfully
pursuing his accustomed labours.</p>

<p>The works of the other nameless namesake were
of a more profound and solid character. They embraced
the large circle of politics, history, biography,
language, and various criticism. They are as numerous
and elaborate as those of the Spanish Cervantes,
or of our own Philemon Holland. But they
evinced deep research, extensive investigation, profound
thinking, great judgment, and, it might almost
be said, uncircumscribed knowledge.</p>

<p>Different as they were in talents, in their pursuits,
dispositions and manners, both distinguished
the Sexagenarian with their intimate acquaintance,
and both continued with him, as long as he remained
near them, a pleasing interchange of such literary
stock as they severally possessed.</p>

<p>Vere mihi hoc videor esse dicturus, ex omnibus iis qui
in harum artium studiis liberalissimis sint, doctrinisque versati
minimam copiam poetarum egregiorum extitisse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

</div>

<p>In turning over the pages of the manuscript which
has afforded the materials for these Volumes, it
excited no little surprize, that in a literary life so
extended and diversified, there seemed to be no
mention of poetry or poets. It was notorious that
the Sexagenarian had a sort of propensity for the
art, and had dabbled in it himself; but it seemed
odd that having lived with most of those, who, in
his day, were considered as more or less accomplished
in this way, he should no where notice
either them or their productions.</p>

<p>But surprize had hardly subsided, when in one
of the covers, carefully secured by a wafer, some
memoranda on this subject were discovered, to
which the motto which heads this Chapter was prefixed.
They were written in a very small hand,
and like many other portions of the manuscript,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
appeared like hasty notes to be revised at some
more favourable opportunity. They are, however,
subjoined with little, indeed with no other alteration,
than not allowing the introduction of the first
person.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, observes the writer, in the
experience of a tolerably protracted life, how few
examples have presented themselves of individuals
avowing a devotion to the poetic art, and cultivating
it with persevering diligence, who have really
deserved the appellation of poets. Cicero thus remarks—“Sæpe
audivi poetam bonum neminem id
quod a Democrito et Platone in scriptis relictum
esse dicunt, sine inflammatione animorum existere
posse et sine quodam afflatu quasi furoris.”</p>

<p>The “Furor” has been sufficiently conspicuous
within the last thirty years, but the genuine “Afflatus”
has been rarely communicated.</p>

<p>From what principle, or rather from what infirmity
of man’s nature can it proceed, that the writer
of poetry is endowed with a greater portion of self-complacency,
with respect to his own compositions,
than any other author. Yet the fact is so, and
the affirmation that it is, is as old as the age of
Augustus. May not the appeal too safely be made,
even to the present æra, whether the same self-confidence
does not still characterize the poetic
tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>Cicero had no possible pretensions to the character
of a poet, yet there is sufficient evidence that
he thought very well of his own poetical compositions.
It is his remark, that every poet thinks his own productions
better than those of any other person.</p>

<p>After relating the beautiful story of Damocles
and the tyrant Dionysius, speaking of the latter
he says,</p>

<p>“Musicorum vero perstudiosum accepimus,
poetam etiam tragicum: quam bonum nihil ad
rem. In hoc enim genere nescio quo pacto magis,
quam in aliis suum cuique pulchrum est. Adhuc
neminem cognovi poetam, et mihi fuit cum Aquinio
amicitia, qui sibi non optimus videretur. Sic se
res habet. Te tua, me delectant mea.”</p>

<p>But enough of this digressive excursion. The
following are rough outlines of modern poets, personally
known to, and more or less familiarly connected
with the author.</p>

<p>With respect to one or two of the first and
earliest, there appears no manner of necessity for
concealment or disguise. They have long settled
their accounts with respect to reputation, and their
names are not yet quite forgotten.</p>

<p>The first introduction of the kind was to John
Home, the author of Douglas, who was then, on
account of the success of this tragedy, in considerable
reputation as a dramatic author. He was an
enlightened and agreeable man; and though he
had not the dexterity or the power to conciliate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
the good graces of Garrick, he had the better fortune
of being complimented by Hume the historian
on his rivalling Shakespeare in genius. Alas!
neither his contemporaries, nor posterity acceded,
or will accede to this eulogium. He wrote other
things for the stage, but this of Douglas alone succeeded,
and this, it is to be apprehended, will not
perpetuate his name.</p>

<p>The communication with the amiable and accomplished
translator of Ariosto and Tasso, was much
more frequent, as well as more familiar. When
his disadvantages of early education are taken into
consideration, for as Dr. Johnson facetiously observed,
he was <i>regularly</i> brought up in Grub street,
it may reasonably excite surprize, that his progress
in knowledge should be so considerable and so diversified.</p>

<p>He was a very respectable scholar, and his acquaintance
with the Italian language in particular
was remarkably accurate. His versions of the three
great Italian poets, still retain no contemptible
portion of the public favour; his Metastasio more
than either, attracted notice and obtained applause.
But his original compositions were few, and not
very much distinguished by the animation of genius.
His name has not undeservedly found a
place in the annals of modern biography, but they
who are most partial to his memory, however they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
may have been delighted with his mild and engaging
manners, must be satisfied with having their favourite
comprehended in the class of our minor
poets.</p>

<p>The next person who was classed among the
poets of his day, and rather in the first rank than
the second, should perhaps in point of accuracy
have preceded those who are here placed before
him. This was Soame Jenyns. It would be superfluous
to say any thing here of his literary character
or pretensions. The public taste has long
since decided upon the station to which he is entitled
among authors. But he was a poet, and personally
known to the Sexagenarian, and therefore not improperly
introduced on this occasion.</p>

<p>His appearance, dress, manner, and conversation,
were very eccentric, and those of his wife, who
generally accompanied him on his visits, were no less
so. The lady here alluded to was his second wife,
who entertained so exalted an idea of her husband’s
accuracy and propriety of conversation, that she acquired
the habit of always repeating the last sentence
of any thing he said. Thus when the gentleman
observed, we had a disagreeable journey to
town, the roads were bad, we were sadly jolted,
the lady would immediately repeat the observation,
“Yes, as Mr. Jenyns says, we were sadly jolted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>But we have nothing to do here but with his
merits as a poet, and his claims to permanent reputation
in that character. His poems were published
collectively in the volumes of Dodsley, and whoever
pleases, may judge of their value. But they
excited no great interest when originally written;
they excite less at the present period, and will probably
glide down the stream of time, till, with the
mob of gentlemen who write with ease, they sink
into the waters of oblivion.</p>

<p>Much of the same class and pretensions as to
poetical merit, though in other respects with less
various, and much more limited intellectual powers,
was Jerningham.</p>

<p>With this gentleman there was a personal acquaintance
of many years continuance, and it was
impossible not to be pleased with his amiable and
elegant manners. Whilst he lived he was highly
respected for his very cultivated mind, and for a
long series of years he was ranked in the first class
of his contemporary poets. Unluckily for the fabric
of his poetical fame, two ill-betiding lines from
a wicked satirist overset it almost in a moment.</p>

<p>Nobody was presumptuous enough to praise the
versification of this unfortunate bard, after reading
in the Baviad,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“See snivelling Jerningham at fifty weep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er love-lorn oxen and deserted sheep.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>Yet perhaps this was somewhat too harsh. Jerningham
did write some things which were marked
with good sense, good feeling, and polished versification.
Unhappily he was considered as forming
one of the fraternity, whose labours in this way
tended to the corruption of the public taste, and
the scythe of the all-potent satirical mower, cut
him down with the rest, never to rise again.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in opposition to the censures,
which it cannot be denied, were injurious to his
reputation, the poet had to produce the strong and
powerful commendation of Burke; no mean testimony
surely. Neither can it be supposed that
living familiarly as he did, and continued to do till
the end of his life, in familiar intimacy with the
noble and the great, his tranquillity was materially
discomposed by an assault, to which every literary
adventurer is alike exposed.</p>

</div>

<p>The individual next in succession was, and perhaps
is, (for he may yet survive) a man of unquestionable
genius; capable of high undertakings, both
in prose and verse; but it is only with his qualifications
and claims as a poet, that we have anything
here to do.</p>

<p>Strange to say, but such is the perverseness of
human nature, that the wisest among us, are sometimes
apt to mistake our talents, and to plume ourselves
most, upon those qualities, from the exercise
of which, in the opinions of the more discerning
and judicious, we are least entitled to applause.</p>

<p>This remark is in some degree applicable to our
present subject. The person to whom the attention
of the reader is now invited, had certainly,
when very young, a great taste and talent for poetical
composition, and produced, almost before
manhood, a poem which obtained the strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span> commendations
of Dr. Johnson. This valuable praise,
added to the delight which every youthful poet
feels from the exercise of so agreeable an accomplishment,
induced him probably to persevere in
this particular pursuit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his talents of this kind, however
exercised, cultivated, and improved, would never
have placed him in the first rank of British poets;
whereas, by study and by discipline, he might have
rivalled the best of our historians.</p>

<p>This was manifestly proved by the execution of a
work which will outlive all his poetry. A subject
was proposed to him, by a great and accomplished
character, long since no more, with which he was
not in the smallest degree acquainted, except as a
man of general information. It presented itself
to him, clouded and perplexed with obscurity and
difficulty; but he sat sturdily to work, and produced
at intervals an historical performance of
several volumes, which, as it richly deserved, was
exceedingly well received by his countrymen.</p>

<p>When once the subject had occupied his mind,
and fixed his studious attention, it is really wonderful
with what sagacity, acuteness, and effect, he
pursued it in all its ramifications. Nothing relating
to it was unexplored, and the result of the
whole will perpetuate his name. Yet would it
have excited no surprize in him who made the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span> above
observations, to have been told, that his old friend,
(and we may add one of his oldest) was by no
means satisfied with the above determination with
regard to his literary claims. The appellation of
poet, first given him among his school-fellows, was
dear, as it was familiar from his boyhood. It grew
with his growth. It was universally bestowed upon
him through the progress of life, as an acknowledged
Prænomen, and it is more than probable that he
considered it at least of equal value, with any other
which could possibly have been conferred, from his
most successful prosecution of any different branch
of literature.</p>

<p>Subjoined to the above observations is the following
apostrophe:—</p>

<p>Yes! my old friend ⸺ was a character of no
ordinary calibre, eccentric as a boy, eccentric as
a man; nor at all less so, as life appeared to decline.
But his eccentricity was injurious only to himself.
His heart was warm, perhaps too susceptible, and
too prone to yield to first impressions. But he was
generous even to excess, nor could any length of
time obliterate his sense of favours received. His
hospitable spirit could hardly be circumscribed
within any limits; his cheerfulness almost always
uninterrupted. The most untoward incidents threw
no more than a transient cloud over his countenance,
and he frequently could observe of himself, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
greatest good-humour, that he never was unhappy
after dinner. Of his failings, nothing will here be
observed. Such would not be the office of a friend,
who for a long series of years had received from him
the most affectionate attention, had passed the most
pleasing hours and days in his society, delighted with
his good-humour, cheered by his vivacity, and perhaps
not unimproved by the collision of their
mutual talents and interchange of the knowledge,
in which they were severally proficient.</p>

<p>Of his talents, perhaps, sufficient may have been
said; of these, he, who knew him for the space of
no less a period than forty years, who was generally
acquainted with his mode of occupying his time,
his studious pursuits, and literary employments,
may be supposed no incompetent judge. He was
acute, prompt, active, and persevering, in all he
undertook; perhaps somewhat to be censured for
not more duly observing the Horatian axiom, of
submitting for a longer period, the productions of
his pen to the last examination of his judgment.
He thus exposed himself to the attacks of the critical
tribe, of whom the greater number are alike
acute in detecting, and severe in censuring, the
errors of authors. Notwithstanding this, however,
and other checks and impediments, he pursued the
usual tenor of his way, unintimidated and undisturbed,
dividing his time as usual, between poetry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
and prose compositions, cheered as he went along
by a numerous circle of friends and acquaintance;
nor when he who wrote the above withdrew from
his ken, had there existed any occasion to whisper
in his ear the warning which Gil Blas felt it his
duty to suggest to the Archbishop of Salamanca.</p>

</div>

<p>The next personage, had he yet lived, would
have been seriously offended at being classed only
in the middle rank of poets; but great as his genius
actually was, with a fine and cultivated taste,
founded on classical knowledge, and improved by
almost uninterrupted exercise, will posterity allow
the best of Cumberland’s poetical productions, a
loftier station? It may, nevertheless, be questioned
whether he did not as much pride himself upon
“Calvary,” as upon the best of his dramatic productions,
or upon his excellent collection of Essays
in his Observer.</p>

<p>He could not easily endure a rival in any branch
of literature, but, without entering into his failings,
it may easily be conceded that he had not in his
time many equals. His talents were so various,
his productions so numerous, and of many of
them it may truly be asserted, that they were so
valuable and so instructive, that who can call to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
memory without a sigh that his latter hours were
darkened by poverty.</p>

<p>He excited in the writer of these brief notices
the sincerest esteem and regard, notwithstanding
that, after having for years enjoyed his most intimate
familiarity, he by an untoward accident provoked
his displeasure. The accident was this.</p>

<p>When employed in writing the incidents of his
own life, with the view of publication, Mr. C. applied
to the Sexagenarian to revise the manuscript
and correct the press. This appeared to be both
a difficult and a perilous office; the well-known
irritable temper of the author presented itself as a
frightful spectre to the imagination, breathing discontent,
impatience, and dispute. The same misfortune,
however, ensued from declining, as perhaps
would have resulted from the performance of the
task. Mr. C. was much offended, and the intimacy
became less and less cordial. Alas, poor
ghost!</p>

<p>Mild, good, amiable, and ingenious, another personage
presents himself; but however earnest the
disposition might be to increase, rather than detract,
from his honours, candour and truth compel the
peremptory decision, that he can only be classed
among the minor poets. He was an elegant scholar,
and his versification evinced much facility of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
composition, and no inconsiderable portion of taste;
but his translation of Horace was never exceedingly
popular, nor did it pass, it is believed, to a second
edition. It may appear singular, but it is nevertheless
true, that though sometimes heavy and prosaic,
and defective in energy, the work of old
Francis is still referred to, and keeps its place in
our libraries.</p>

<p>Subsequently to the Horace, a volume of poems
was published by this author, which were characterized
by the same qualities of good taste, by easy
and often elegant versification, but the reader would
look in vain for “thoughts that breathe, and words
that burn.”</p>

<p>Another friend and contemporary might, if he
had so pleased, have asserted higher claims as a
poet, but he exercised the talent for amusement
only, though he sometimes made use of it as an
accompaniment to labours of a more serious and
exalted kind. He was a philosopher in every sense
of the word; a most elegant classical scholar; and
there were few branches of science in which he was
not well versed. But his great distinction was an
accurate and familiar knowledge of natural history
in all its branches.</p>

<p>In this line of science he was pre-eminently accomplished,
not only in the opinion of his countrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
but of all Europe. He was of a truly
manly mind and character, and but little regarded
the occasional opposition to his opinions, though
urged with all the force of aristocratical influence,
and all the vehemence of personal dislike. He
pursued the even tenor of his way unintimidated
and unshaken. One inconsiderate disregard of
some established regulation, by which he could have
no possible object in view, but the extension and
benefit of science, placed him for a time in an awkward
and unpleasant predicament. When envy is
armed with power, woe be to the ill-fated wight
against whom its arrows are directed. Yet in this
instance they were aimed in vain. The sevenfold
shield of superior attainments, wielded by the
strong arm of unimpeached integrity, proudly defied
all the malice of his adversaries. It is, indeed,
observes the writer, pleasing to remember the dignified
contempt, with which he received and returned
certain salutations of constrained civility
from a lofty personage, to whom he was confessedly
superior in every thing but rank.</p>

<p>Although not a few memoranda still remain on
the subject of poetical contemporaries, it seems
time to pause. Let it suffice to observe that the
following personages are mentioned in terms of
esteem and regard, and as authors of various elegant
compositions in verse—Sotheby, the Translator
of Persius, Bowles, Park, Farhill, John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Anstey, Serjeant, Sir James Burges, W. Spencer,
Kett, with a train of etceteras.</p>

<p>The following, by one of those above described,
may, perhaps have been printed before. Its elegance
merits perpetuity, and is here given from
the Author’s own manuscript.</p>

</div>

<p>The Chapter which is now about to succeed, is
to us incomprehensible. It is literally transcribed
from the manuscript, and the reader is at liberty to
make what he can of it.</p>

<p>“Pray my dear, addressing myself in a very soft
tone to “the Lady,” when will it be convenient
for you to suffer me to invite a select party
of brother authors, to partake of a humble repast?</p>

<p>Whom in particular do you wish to ask?</p>

<p>You know all my literary friends and connections,
and I think I cannot do better than to leave
the selection to yourself.</p>

<p>Well then I have no objection, provided you do
not invite the <span class="smcap">rich author</span>.</p>

<p>Whom is it you mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>I am surprized at your dullness. Pray are there
many rich authors?</p>

<p>Certainly not.</p>

<p>Well, then, I mean that man who, because he
has a great command of money, and has written
some trifling pieces of poetry, assumes great personal
importance, and crosses on the other side to
avoid the salutation of men far superior to himself
in genius and learning, who having heard from one
of your old poets, that I have heard you talk about,
that they who drink water can never produce a good
poem, conceives himself to be a solitary exception,
and that the pure stream of Helicon is reserved
exclusively for him.</p>

<p>Enough, my dear, the Rich Author shall not
break bread with us.</p>

<p>Neither would I have you ask the <span class="smcap">noble author</span>.
Him, I mean, who is certainly possessed
of great intellectual powers, and a peculiar turn
for a certain line of poetry; but whose bad passions
so perpetually insinuate themselves in every thing
which he writes, that it is hardly possible to escape
the injury of his venom, and scarcely worth while to
separate the gold from the dross. His volatile
mind thinks it an act of manliness to sneer at religion,
and if on any occasion provoked to resentment,
his malignity becomes fury, and there is no
object either too high or too low upon which he
does not vent his rancour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>Agreed—neither shall he eat our salt.</p>

<p>On no account send an invitation to the <span class="smcap">vain
author</span>.</p>

<p>I fear too many of my brethren fall under that
denomination; but whom is it that you more particularly
wish to except?</p>

<p>I mean him to whom I very willingly concede
the most perfect good-nature, the most friendly disposition
and no mean portion of ability. But, indeed,
my dear friend, he is so tiresome with his
long eternal stories, that he imposes a restraint
upon that variety of conversation which is the great
charm of an amicable meeting. I have no other
fault to find with him. I would rather however
have him, than the <span class="smcap">pompous author</span>.</p>

<p>I do not immediately comprehend to whom you
allude.</p>

<p>To whom can I allude but to that big man who,
you all agree, could have done so much, and has
actually done so little. Who upon ten pages of
letter press hangs a large volume of notes; whose
political creed always obtruded, has been at perpetual
war with his real interests; and whose style
delights so in antithesis, that it seems to himself
imperfect without it; who delivers his opinions
with a sort of pedagogical authority, and brow-beats
those whom he is unable to confute; who has
wasted much of his time and talent in individual
disputation, and at a considerably advanced period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
of life, finds that from some cause or other he has
made but little progress towards that rank, in which,
as far as talents, improved by much and deep
learning, are concerned, he might, by the easy restraint
or chastisement of his opinions, have enlightened
and adorned society.</p>

<p>But my dear child your negative catalogue is so
extensive that I begin to fear I shall not make up
a party.</p>

<p>Oh yes you may, but for heaven’s sake do not let
us have the <span class="smcap">bland author</span>.</p>

<p>Bless me, whom can you mean?</p>

<p>Nay, nay, you know well enough—Whom can I
possibly mean but that eternal writer of poetry, who
composes verses upon every trifling incident which
occurs in the circles of fashion; prints whatever he
composes, and recites them gratuitously both before
and afterwards; whose collected works would
fill half your library, but if they had been compelled
to keep their peace nine years, would, in all
probability, have never spoken at all. Who, if—</p>

<p>Stop, stop, I entreat you, look on the other side
of the picture, and candidly allow that a better tempered
creature never breathed; kind, benevolent,
and friendly; and whatever may be your opinion,
allowed by most people to possess an excellent
memory, happy articulation, and no inconsiderable
portion of taste. However, we will ask him on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
some other occasion.</p>

<p>But my dear have you any other exceptions to
make?</p>

<p>No I think not—Yes, yes, I would on no account
have that <span class="smcap">dull author</span>.</p>

<p>Now, my good child, you are entirely incomprehensible,
or rather perhaps you mean delicately to
intimate that I am not to have my meditated Symposium.
Have not all authors their intervals of dullness?
Has not Homer himself been accused of occasionally
nodding? Well, but to whom do you
immediately look?</p>

<p>Why to that bonny man who has printed as many
thick quartos as would outweigh himself, comprehending
etymology, criticism, politics, geography,
antiquity, poetry, nay, the whole circle of the sciences.
I have no particular, and certainly not any
personal, objection to his society, but as you do
me the favour to admit me of your parties, I think
it would be possible to find an individual of better
conversation talents, of more interesting, if not of
more diversified information.</p>

<p>See how it is—Whilst we have been deliberating
about whom we shall invite to our party, without
fixing even upon one, the whole morning has
slipped away, and I have a particular engagement
with my bookseller. We will talk the matter
over again to-morrow, and I hope you will then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
be prepared to determine upon a few at least, from
whose society we may derive mutual gratification.
I fear we shall agree but on a few, for our board
is small and our taste fastidious.</p>

<p>One thing has occurred this morning which will
prevent my inviting the <span class="smcap">Bigot Author</span>. You
know his religious creed, and with that we have
no right to interfere; but a friend of his lately
though of the same persuasion, sent his son as
a student to Trinity College, Cambridge. The
alarm was spread throughout the sect, and the
Bigot Author was deputed to remonstrate, first on
the impropriety of the thing itself, and, above all,
on the very gross and obvious offence to the society,
in confiding the main branch of so distinguished
a member to the possible influence of a
seminary bearing so odious an appellation as that
of <span class="smcap">Trinity</span>.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

</div>

<p>The parties, as it should appear, entered again
upon the subject of the Symposium on the following
morning, when the subsequent dialogue took
place.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear child, let us come to some determination,
and either decline the matter altogether,
or fix upon the time, circumstance, and persons
to be invited to our social repast.</p>

<p>Well then, that you may not think me capricious
and fantastical, I will propose no other exceptions.
Pray let us ask the <span class="smcap">witty author</span>.</p>

<p>I think I guess whom you mean, but do you apply
those epithets to the individual himself, and his
powers of conversation, or to his works?</p>

<p>Why to say the truth, I more immediately thought
of his lively, agreeable, and interesting company
and conversation, than I did of his works. For,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
although he has certainly written many things,
which may reasonably claim the character both of
wit and humour, I well know his works are of the
more solid and substantial kind, works of importance
to religion, to morals, and to literature.</p>

<p>Enough, enough, you well know he may have
as much of our salt as he pleases.</p>

<p>We will also invite, if you please, <span class="smcap">the satirist</span>.</p>

<p>That word is generally used, among us, in a
harsh sense. But you know my opinion on the
subject of satire, and must remember, that when
satire is moderated by candour, and regulated by
the mere desire of reforming error, without being
stimulated by personal dislike, or individual resentment,
it is alike honourable and salutary.</p>

<p>You describe the character of our Satirist very
accurately. I know not which of his qualities inspires
most approbation, the placid, instructive tenor
of his conversation in private society, or the dignified
and spirited demeanour with which he mounts
his Pegasus, to restrain folly, chastise error, and
disperse the gaudy mob of poetasters.</p>

<p>Who next? though these two are of themselves a
host.</p>

<p>Why we will have <span class="smcap">one noble author</span>.</p>

<p>I cannot be much at a loss to know whom you
intend, as our acquaintance in that line is not very
extensive. What is the cause of your partiality to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
him?</p>

<p>I like him, in the first place, because he never
presumes upon his rank and title; because he descends
to easy and elegant familiarity with every
guest; and, moreover, because he has seen much,
travelled much, and knows much; he neither arrogantly
intrudes in conversation, or petulantly withholds
the information he is so qualified to communicate.</p>

<p>We get on so smoothly now that it seems necessary
to remind you of the smallness of our apartment.
Have you any body else to name?</p>

<p>Oh yes, by all means, let us have the <span class="smcap">facetious
author</span>.</p>

<p>Mean you a writer of facetious books?</p>

<p>Why, yes, that may be said, and said truly. He
has been a <i>projector</i> of many truly facetious and
original schemes, which he has detailed for the advantage,
as well as amusement, of the public. I
rather, however, thus designated him on account of
the unvaried pleasantry and good-humour of his
conversation. This has long been the delight of
his friends, for it is always the same, always flows
in the same even channel of ingenuous mirth. He
never fatigues you with the repetition of what you
have heard a thousand times before, but has a perpetual
supply from his stores of memory for the
promotion of cheerfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>Now you have proceeded thus far without interruption
or contradiction, you will, I hope, permit
me to name one of our guests, to whom I think it
impossible you should object.</p>

<p>I don’t know that. But—</p>

<p>You know how I abominate that monosyllable
<i>But</i>—I must insist upon asking my very old friend,
and your’s also, Sylvanus Urban.</p>

<p>You really anticipate me. He is worthy of a
place at any table, and I should no more think of
selecting a party from those whom I most esteemed,
and best love, without soliciting his presence, than
I would have our turbot (<i>Husband</i> aside—<i>mem</i>,
there <i>must</i> be a turbot!) without lobster, or partridges
without bread-sauce.</p>

<p>You are perfectly right, yet pray tell me under
what description of authors would you rank our old
friend? What epithet would you apply to him?</p>

<p>Why I think Sylvanus Urban may be termed the
<span class="smcap">universal author</span>.</p>

<p>I agree with you entirely, for few indeed are the
branches of science, to the extension and improvement
of which, his labours have not contributed.
Voluminous as are the productions of his pen, and
consisting, as they do, of historical and antiquarian
researches, in almost every ramification of the
Belles Lettres, envy itself can hardly single out one
which has not obtained the gratitude of the particular
class of readers, for whose amusement and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
benefit, they were more immediately intended.</p>

<p>But this is not all, and abruptly to break off the
delineation of the portrait here, would be ungenerous
and unjust. He has done more; he has not
only contributed to the interests of literature by his
own individual exertions—he has been a patron to
others. If his means did not permit him to be
munificent, he was steady and constant in his assistance
to those who wanted and required it. The
benefit of his experience, of his advice and judgment,
was at the service of every less practised
writer. If a wrong path had been pursued, he
pointed out the right, and thus has often prevented
the waste both of time and talent. His benevolence
was uncircumscribed, guided by no prejudice,
restrained by no feelings of party. His patience
and fortitude, and christian resignation, in
the greatest trials to which humanity can be exposed,
was almost without parallel, firm and unshaken.
In return he has experienced universal
sympathy and esteem, and will descend to his last
home revered, honoured, and beloved.</p>

<p>Well, but our table is not filled yet. Suppose
we invite the <span class="smcap">learned author</span>.</p>

<p>Alas! so many of my learned friends, properly
thus called, have paid the tribute of mortality, that
I cannot be at a loss to know whom you mean.
An admirable guest must he needs be at any table,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
for to the profoundest learning and acutest discernment,
he joins the most affable and lively powers
of conversation, and easily and cheerfully abstracts
himself from the more abstruse objects of
his thoughts, to contribute to the general festivity.</p>

<p>Memory loves to retrace the earlier and brighter
scenes of life, when the gratification now proposed
was repeatedly enjoyed with this and other learned
men, of whom many have fallen asleep. Where
wit and humour, and a reciprocity of communication,
not easily paralleled, diffused universal complacency.
Where—</p>

<p>Stop, stop—a truce to this melancholy mood,
and let us consider the number of our party.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">witty author</span>—<span class="smcap">the satirist</span>—<span class="smcap">the
noble author</span>—<span class="smcap">the factious author</span>—<span class="smcap">Sylvanus
Urban</span>—<span class="smcap">the learned author</span>.</p>

<p>Six—with ourselves—Eight. Shall we not ask
a female?</p>

<p>Run over in your mind the Female Authors with
whom we have acquaintance, and determine which
of them you will invite. Shall it be Mrs. ⸺.</p>

<p>Oh! no, no. She is certainly exceedingly clever
and accomplished, and can be very agreeable; but
she values herself so highly on her musical talents,
that she will be affronted, if not entreated to sing
one of her Bravura songs, which to me are detestable,
nor do I think them so very delightful to you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Besides she expects to be first fiddle, and demands
from the celebrity of her name, more attention, than
is consistent with that equality which ought invariably
to prevail in friendly meetings.</p>

<p>Will you ask Miss ⸺?</p>

<p>No, I think not. She is a mighty good sort of
person, and nobody disputes her cleverness; but
she is suspected of taking notes of the conversations,
at which she may be present, and you must
not be surprized if, when you least expect it, you
find some observation, or anecdote, or chit chat,
gravely inserted in some note in an original novel,
or translation from some of the books vended at
Leipsic fair.</p>

<p>But why must this female be an author? Need
we go far to find one, who though she has never
written any thing for publication, has one of the finest
understandings in the world, a correct taste, admirable
judgment, refined manners, joined to the
sweetest temper in the world; whose conversation
is far preferable to the pedantry of any half-learned
<i>Precieuse</i>, or the confidence which has been inspired
by flattery unduly bestowed.</p>

<p>You need say no more. Eliza shall complete
our party.</p>

</div>

<p>He, who like our friend, shall have consumed a
life of some considerable length, in the professed
service of literature, must necessarily have had
much and familiar connection with a class of men,
among whom will be found as great a variety of
character, as can possibly distinguish any individuals
of any profession—<span class="smcap">Booksellers</span>.</p>

<p>Innumerable anecdotes, observations, and matters
of fact, concerning Booksellers, were found
scattered among the Sexagenarian’s papers. If they
were to be arranged in a connected form, they
would probably form an amusing and interesting
narrative. But such is neither the office of the
Editor, nor if it were, has he the adequate ability
to perform it in a manner which might do credit to
the original author. The reader must, therefore,
be satisfied with some selected scraps, which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
placed in a tolerably chronological order, and
which exhibit the first feelings and first adventures
of a young author, in the mysterious arcana of copy,
proofs, printing, and publishing.</p>

<p>The proudest and the most celebrated writers,
whose productions adorn our annals, would, if
earnestly interrogated, candidly, without doubt, acknowledge,
that the warmest and most anxious
wish of early genius is to see its first effusions in
print.</p>

<p>Those compositions, which in the beginning, perhaps,
celebrate the irresistible fascination of a mild
blue eye, the more than ambrosial sweetness of a ruby
lip, or the extacy beyond description, of a stolen kiss,
are folded with a tremulous hand, and dispatched in
an envelope to a magazine or newspaper, with a
humble note, purporting, that “the Author of this
specimen, if it shall be approved, will be happy to
become a regular and frequent correspondent.”</p>

<p>What an awful interval between the first birth
of a juvenile composition, and its last solemn reception
or rejection! Who can tell but he who has
experienced similar emotions, the anxious expectancy,
when sentence is to be pronounced? The
delight of reading, the favour of “Juvenis” is received,
and will be inserted: we shall be glad of
this correspondent’s communications in future.”
Delight! only to be exceeded by the mortification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
and abasement of perusing words of the following
import:—“We would advise our correspondent,
who signs himself Oxon, to read, and not to write
at present.”</p>

<p>At this place, our Sexagenarian candidly relates
the following anecdote of himself:—When as yet
almost <i>imberbis</i>, he had translated into Latin hexameters
and pentameters, the celebrated ballad
from the Spanish, thus rendered by Garrick.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For me my fair a wreath had wove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where rival flowers in union meet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft as she kiss’d the gift of love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her breath gave sweetness to the sweet.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A bee beneath a damask rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Had crept, the liquid dew to sip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But lesser sweets the thief foregoes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And fixes on Louisa’s lip.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then tasting all the bloom of spring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Waked by the ripening breath of May,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ ungrateful spoiler left his sting,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And with the honey flew away.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He had taken sufficient pains to satisfy himself,
and with some particles of vanity, showed them to
two or three of his friends, who praised the composition,
and recommended him to send it to the
editor of a popular publication. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span> was accordingly
done, and long and irksome did the interval
appear, till the solemn period of his fate arrived.
It came at length, and with no ordinary exultation
he beheld himself in print. His ambition from
this moment began to soar; in imagination he already
saw poetic crowns soliciting his acceptance, and
the wondering crowds pointing and exclaiming—That
is he!</p>

<p>Alas! the most exalted of human enjoyments are
subject to diminution from envy or from malice.
In the very next magazine which succeeded, was a
pert and saucy letter signed Aristarchus, purporting,
that in the Latin translation of Garrick’s version
from the Spanish, which appeared last month,
there were two false quantities, for which a boy in
the fourth form, either at Eton or Westminster,
would deservedly have been flogged.</p>

<p>The cud was chewed upon this most ungracious
verberation for a considerable time, nor was complacency
fully restored, till in acknowledgment of a
prose essay inserted in the same journal, a handsome
set of books was conveyed to the author.</p>

<p>But to return to <span class="smcap">Booksellers</span>. The first resort
of young men who possess any literary curiosity
is usually a bookseller’s shop, and if the proprietor
be a man of experience in his business, and
of a courteous communicative disposition, an acquaintance
with him may prove of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
benefit to the student. He learns from him the
value, not in a professed collector’s sense of that
word, but the relative excellence of different editions.
He hears also of new works in contemplation;
he meets individuals of similar propensities
with himself, and an agreeable interchange of knowledge
and information is thereby promoted. Above
all, he obtains the enviable privilege of seeing publications
which his finances will not suffer him to
purchase, and enjoys the no small indulgence of
an early sight of the periodical publications.</p>

<p>In the provincial town where our friend in early
life resided, there were three booksellers of very
different characters and attainments. One was a
shrewd, cold, inflexible fellow, who traded principally
in old books, and held out but little encouragement
to a youth who rarely had money to expend,
to become a frequenter of his shop. Of
course, frequent visits were not paid by out Sexagenarian
to him. The principal feature of this
man’s character was suspicion of strangers, and a
constant apprehension lest he should dispose of any
of his “Libri Rarissimi” to some cunning wight, or
professed collector. If any Customer was announced
as coming from the Metropolis, he immediately added
at least one-third to his price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>The second of this fraternity was a sharp, chattering,
clever fellow in his way, but he wanted ballast,
and was suspected of paying more attention to
conviviality out of doors, than to ledgers and catalogues
within. No great temptation was here held
out to intimacy.</p>

<p>The third, who enjoyed the best business, and
the best customers, was a facetious, jolly, honest
sort of body, who welcomed every visitor to his
shop, and with great good-nature accommodated
his youthful customers with the loan of books, which
they did not deem it necessary, or find it convenient,
to buy. This was a period, when on the
decease of some neighbouring clergyman, or of
provincial collector, his library, whatever might
have been its original cost, or real value, was generally
disposed of to the nearest bookseller, for such
a sum as his conscience might induce him to give.
By many such speculations, and by one in particular,
this same bookseller was able to live very reputably,
and became ambitious of extending his concerns,
and of becoming a Publisher.</p>

<p>To him, therefore, the Sexagenarian, on his desire
of first appearing in the character of a professed
author, eagerly applied. He had completed
a composition of no great importance indeed in extent,
but which, having perused it with great complacency
himself, he thought might produce reputation,
at least, if not emolument. An interview was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
appointed to discuss the subject. But here Alps
upon Alps seemed to arise, Pelion on Ossa mounted.
The minor questions—What size? how many copies?
what price? were got over without much
difficulty. But the final determination of—Who is
to run the risk, and advance the money? was a
matter of solemn deliberation and of awful solicitude.
The author had no money—the bookseller
no inclination to incur any risk. Good-nature and
familiar acquaintance, at length, got the better of
every more sordid feeling, and the publisher consented
to take the pecuniary part of the business
upon himself, provided, that in case of loss, the
author should agree to pay his moiety of it, by such
instalments as his means might permit.</p>

<p>Who shall attempt to describe the exultation and
self-complacency which followed this definitive arrangement,
concerning a brochure of less than
fifty pages? Who but he, who inflamed by the
ambition of authorship, practices, for the first time
in his life, the mysterious characters of the printer,
(the deles, the stets, the transfers, N. P. bring
down, &amp;c.) and for the first time contemplates the
harbinger of that awful charta, ycleped a proof, in
the hands of the devil?</p>

<p>It may be questioned whether our great and venerable
painter, West, first rushed from the forests
of his native America, to enjoy the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span> glories
of the Vatican; first beheld the Belvidere Apollo
with greater enthusiasm, than our friend experienced,
when anxiously expecting his approach, he ran to
meet the devil at his door.</p>

<p>Alas! he little knew the sea of troubles into
which he was about rashly to plunge. His imagination
did not present to him to “grieve his heart,”
like the apparitions which disturbed Macbeth, in
long succession; a crabbed publisher, a mean bookseller,
a fraudulent bookseller, a sneaking bookseller,
or what is as troublesome as any of the rest,
a Coxcomb Bookseller, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>He never anticipated those solemn and afflicting
moments of care and anguish, when the repose and
indulgence necessary after severe intellectual fatigue,
was to be harshly and abruptly interrupted
by the appearance of a terrific spectre, begrimed
with printer’s ink, and vociferating these words, so
torturing to an author’s ear, “More Copy.”</p>

<p>His fancy never brought before him those irritating
and vexatious emotions, when having covenanted
with a greedy and avaricious publisher to
produce a certain number of sheets, and having, to
the satisfaction of his judgment, filled up the outline
he proposed, he is compelled to brood over
some such pithy billet as the following:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Sir,</p>

<p>Having advanced you the sum agreed upon for
two octavo volumes, each containing thirty-five
sheets, we find that Vol. II. wants a sheet and a
half of the proposed quantity. Partner and self
therefore consider you as indebted to us in the sum
of twenty-five pounds, which you will forthwith
please to return.</p>

<p class="center">I am, Sir,</p>

<p class="center">For Partner and self, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>Base caitiff! but a truce to such miserable
dreams. Let us resume the issue of our friend’s
first literary adventure. For the first month after
publication, the stature was more erect, the ears
remarkably vigilant and on the stretch, the visits to
the bookseller’s shop perpetual.</p>

<p>After an interval of a fortnight, with a tremulous
voice the question was proposed, How do we get
on? The reply was not the most exhilarating; I
know not how we <i>get on</i>, but I know we do not
<i>go off</i>. It was, however, subjoined in a consolatory
tone, “Perhaps when we shall be noticed in the
reviews, things may do better.”</p>

<p>Here a new string was vibrated upon. Those
Gorgonian monsters, whose visionary aspect presented
the dogs of Scylla, with more hands than
Briareus, more eyes than Argus, to the disturbed
imagination of the inexperienced author. He fancied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
to himself a solemn and formidable conclave
of grave, severe, and profound scholars, with bushy
wigs and frowning brows, formally assembled to
pronounce their irreversible sentence upon every
production of literary adventurers. The abrupt
and sarcastic irony with which the efforts of some
unfledged authors were dismissed, haunted him in
his sleep, and appalled his very soul.</p>

<p>He knew better afterwards, being himself admitted
behind the curtain, but in this dreadful interval,
his anxiety was of no ordinary kind. He
had perpetually before his eyes Homer’s description
of Scylla and Charybdis.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No bird of air, no dove of swiftest wing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That bears ambrosia to the ethereal king,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shuns these dire rocks—in vain she cuts the skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dire rocks meet, and crush her as she flies.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here Scylla bellows from her dire abodes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tremendous pest, abhorred by men and gods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hideous her voice, and with less terrors roar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The whelps of lions in the midnight hour.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His bookseller usually received the magazines and
reviews on the evening before their general publication,
and had the good nature to indulge the
Aspirant after literary distinction, with a previous
of these arbiters of destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>No sooner had the bugle of the guard announced
the arrival of the mail, than, with hurried step and
nervous solicitude, a visit was paid to the bookseller.
Alas! the poor author’s fame had not yet
reached the cognizance of those, whose determination
was to fix its value. Another month succeeded,
and yet another, and a similar disappointment and
mortification was experienced. At length, in the
latter part of the monthly catalogue of one of these
Lunar oracles, the following remark appeared.—</p>

<p>“This is a work not entirely without merit, but
it is evidently the production of a youthful author,
who will write better when he shall have read more.”</p>

<p>Nothing was to be done but to put it up, and
say no more about it. The only perplexity was to
settle matters with the bookseller, who, after producing
accurate accounts of advertisements, paper,
printing, and cancels, was enabled to pay the
author the sum of thirteen shillings and eightpence!</p>

<p>Before we change the scene from provincial to
metropolitan booksellers, something is to be said
of an individual, mentioned in our notes under the
appellation of the Dirty Bookseller.</p>

<p>Our friend, in his youthful rambles, on some
occasion or other, found himself in a country town,
where his curiosity was attracted by the sight of
some books at the window of a shop of humble
appearance, in the corner of a street. A temptation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
of this kind was, through the whole of his life,
irresistible. He accordingly entered, and found a
round faced, mean looking, old man, with a small
table before him, examining some catalogues, and
surrounded by book-shelves, on which were some
very curious and very scarce volumes. The old
man with a small capital had watched his opportunity,
and by purchasing the libraries of deceased
clergymen and private gentlemen in his neighbourhood,
and by living with the most parsimonious
frugality, had gradually accumulated very considerable
property.</p>

<p>The incident, perhaps, would hardly have been
worth recording, except from the circumstance that
this humble nest, built in a very obscure part of the
kingdom, subsequently produced a splendid bookseller,
who was succeeded by one equally splendid,
but who might also be termed a Coxcomb Bookseller.</p>

</div>

<p>Surely, exclaims our Sexagenarian, in continuance
of his scraps upon the subject, I shall find
in the Metropolis, booksellers of a different calibre,
men of enlarged minds, liberal ideas, and ample
property, who, even for their own sakes, will be
glad to promote literary industry, and encourage
literary talent. To the metropolis he came, and
almost the first person to whom he was introduced
was a Dry Bookseller.</p>

<p>He was an extensive publisher on all subjects,
and of all parties, from the most subtle and profound
speculations on mathematics and philosophy,
to the humble translation from a French romance.</p>

<p>His own principles were immutable, nor did he
take any pains to conceal them. He was of the
old Presbyterian school, and had imbibed its <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>sourest
manners. Yet he was far from wanting benevolence,
though he generally wore a sort of Sardonic
grin on his countenance; he often shewed kindness
to needy authors, was not over hard in his bargains
with them, and, what is matter of no trifling importance,
would often give them a dinner.</p>

<p>His feelings on the subject of religion, and his
political opinions, may as well be let alone. His
principal fault, as far as authors were concerned,
was a sort of reluctance to come to a final settlement,
which on some occasions, of which our friend
met with one example, was deferred to the Greek
Calends.</p>

<p>Three different works were published by the S. in
conjunction with this personage. The two first were
of no particular interest. They were proposed on
the one part from the <i>res angusta domi</i>, and acceded
to on the other, because, from their subjects, they
offered a reasonable probability of being, in some
degree, successful.</p>

<p>This publisher had a peculiar way of expressing
his decided and peremptory rejection of any work
proposed to him, and this was by one of those Sardonic
grins above-mentioned, which was succeeded
by a sort of sneering laugh. It was not necessary,
indeed it would have been perfectly useless, to have
urged the matter further. He would hardly condescend
to assign motives; this was the sign of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
condemnation. He was an honest man; there was
a consistency in his principles and conduct which
claimed respect. In adherence to these he was exposed
to losses, great personal sacrifices, and personal
sufferings. But on this subject enough has
been said. Let us turn now to the <span class="smcap">Finical Bookseller</span>.</p>

<p>Finical he certainly was and very finical too, but
he had many good points about him, and independent
of the peculiar interests of his profession, had a
taste for literature, and a friendly disposition towards
literary men. Unluckily he had <i>a bit of blood</i> in
him, and the consciousness of this rare distinction
elevated him somewhat above <span class="smcap">the trade</span>, among
whom, however, he possessed a considerable influence
and ascendency. Our friend formed a connection
with him, of no mean importance, nor does
he appear to have had any just cause of complaint,
either with respect to his sagacity or liberality. On
the occasion of their first introduction to each other,
our bookseller appears to have given demonstrative
testimony of both the above qualities. The undertaking
proposed to his consideration, was one of no
very limited extent, requiring, on the part of the
author, continued labour and perseverance, and
promising the publisher a tardy sale, remote advantages,
and requiring, moreover, the immediate advance
of no small sum of money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p>In behalf of the publisher’s liberality it may be
more immediately and forcibly urged, that the
author was at that time an obscure, unpatronized,
young man, who had given no remarkable testimony
of more than common learning, and ordinary
abilities. Nevertheless a mutual confidence was
inspired, and the work proceeded to its successful
conclusion. Till this conclusion there was no interruption
of that harmony and friendship, with which
the undertaking was commenced; but on this occasion
the poor author, for the first time, experienced
that though <i>self</i> might be a very honest fellow,
ready to fulfil his engagements to the very
letter, “partner and self” made a prodigious alteration
in the matter, and threatened the compact
with premature dissolution.</p>

<p>This same partner had not been regularly bred
to the business, and indeed knew but little of the
matter, but he had the money; and though he expressed
the most complacent satisfaction with the
undertaking itself, and great confidence in its successful
execution, when he found that it must of
necessity be extended beyond the limits originally
proposed, he took, or pretended to take alarm, and
to understand that the sum first agreed upon, was
to cover all damages; in other words, that the poor
author was to receive no compensation for his extra
labour on two additional volumes. The matter
was, however, compromised, and the parties brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
their <i>opus magnum</i> to a desirable termination.</p>

<p>Let it not by any means be understood, that by
the epithet Finical, as here applied, any disrespect
is intended, or unkind feeling indulged, with respect
to the individual thus imperfectly delineated. His
coxcombry was of a very harmless kind, and consisted
principally in his adroit and whimsical exercise
of his snuff-box. It was observed on particular
occasions, in his fondness of conversing about his
family, and above all, in his assumed consequential
importance and gestures, when any thing very rare
and choice passed through his hand, which indeed
was often the case.</p>

<p>Come we now to the <span class="smcap">opulent</span> Bookseller.—Our
friend’s connection with this personage was
but slight, and rather amounting to a skirmish
about terms, than to any serious engagement. The
house of which this bookseller was the head, had
been singularly fortunate in their purchases of copy-right,
and there were certain books of which they
were the sole proprietors, and of which a large
impression was annually called for, and which thus
entailed a perpetual and hereditary opulence upon
the establishment.</p>

<p>Among the authors, of whose works they were
the publishers, were numbers of the Great, and
Rich, and Powerful, from many of whom they had
obtained the reputation of being very liberal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span> But
let it be remembered, that the sum which appears
considerable, when paid as a remuneration to Noble
or Episcopal gentlemen, who write for amusement
only, becomes relatively small, when apportioned
to an author by profession, whose comforts and
conveniences of life are obtained principally by the
labour of his brains.</p>

<p>With this latter description of writers, this opulent
personage had a great deal more to do, and
with such he invariably attempted to drive a hard
bargain. Our friend once, it appears, was about
to enter into an engagement with him, of no inconsiderable
magnitude: great labour and perseverance
were required on one part, with the employment
of three years at least, whilst a scanty and
parsimonious remuneration was held out by the
other. However, as the intellectual powers were
then in full vigour, the ardour of literary ambition
progressively increasing, and what perhaps had no
small weight, a number of little people incessantly
crying out for “Crowdy,” the terms, though hard,
were acceded to. A professional gentleman was
employed to draw up the agreement, and a time
was fixed for the signatures of the different parties.
But when the agreement was produced, the reader
may guess the Sexagenarian’s astonishment, at perceiving
a clause of which no warning had been
given, purporting, that if any other <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>publication, or
rather translation, of the same work, should appear
before the final completion and printing of the
present, then the agreement was to be null and
void.</p>

<p>A most notable example of liberality truly! A
poor author was to beat his brains, confine himself
to one arduous labour for two years or more, and
then if a similar work, no matter whence or where,
should steal from its retirement on the eve of the
publication of that in question, there was to be no
compensation, acknowledgment, or reward, for so
much time irretrievably lost. It cannot be a matter
of wonder, that the poor author left the worshipful
bookseller in disgust, (for worshipful he afterwards
became) and never afterwards sought a renewal
of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>It may perhaps in some degree satisfy the
reader’s curiosity, to be informed, that what was
thus prudently guarded against by this cautious man
of wealth, actually took place. In the course of
the two years which immediately succeeded, a precisely
similar work had silently advanced to its
accomplishment, and was suddenly and unexpectedly
announced. Whether this would have superseded
the necessity of the other, or have claimed a
larger share of public approbation, is a matter
which cannot be determined.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

</div>

<p>Let us now introduce our reader to an honest
Bookseller. Let it not be supposed that there exists
any document among our manuscripts to intimate
that it was the author’s intention to designate
an honest bookseller as a non-descript bird, though
perhaps to be classed among the Raræ Aves.</p>

<p>There are among our papers several memoranda
in the highest degree honourable to many
individuals of this numerous fraternity. But certainly
it is not a very usual thing in any of the professions
to have the epithet of “honest” so entirely
hereditary, as to be allowed, not by common, but
by universal consent, to descend, without any bar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
of bastardy, from father to son.</p>

<p>Our friend was much acquainted and connected
with both these worthies. He highly esteemed the
father, and much loved the son. Both had the common
qualities of frankness, with somewhat of bluntness,
and both were ready, on every occasion, to
befriend and assist the followers of literature. In
the immediate line of their profession, they were
alike satisfied with the most reasonable advantages,
and were even remarkable for the moderate prices
which, in their well-stored catalogues, were fixed to
the rarest and the choicest articles.</p>

<p>As publishers they were liberal in their engagements,
and punctual in the performance of them.
Our friend had not many adventures of this kind
in conjunction with them; they were confined, there
is reason to believe, to two, which were, in their
commencement, progress, and conclusion, satisfactory
to all the parties.</p>

<p>One was rather of a ticklish kind; it was full of
hard words, and harsh words, replete with delineations
of certain leading political characters, which
were on one side varnished and beautified in all the
gaudy vestments of flattery, and on the other depressed
with no ordinary weight of acrimony.</p>

<p>Better not attempt it, says one; it is not practicable,
exclaimed another; is it not poaching on
another’s manor, cried a third; expect an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span> Aristarchus
in every page, observed a fourth. At length
an experiment was made, and a specimen inserted
in one of the most popular periodical productions
of the day. This specimen reached the eye of the
mighty Porson, that Coryphæus of learning. Who
may this wight be, observed the Professor, I should
like to be acquainted with him. An acquaintance
accordingly took place, which continued till dissolved
by death.</p>

<p>The labour was great, the difficulties formidable,
the compensation very scanty, but the work
was not in the nature of things likely to have
a popular sale. The publishers readily gave what
the author demanded, and so, like other things of
the kind, it floated for a while upon the stream and
then sunk to the bottom.</p>

<p>The other literary adventure was of a more extensive
and important kind, in which the two honest
gentlemen, above pourtrayed, bore only a part in
common with many others. It is observed in our
notes, that of all the literary undertakings in which
our friend was concerned, this communicated the
least complacent feelings on reflection. A considerable
portion of certainly a curious and interesting
publication was assigned to him, but he was limited
to space, and confined to time. He was on no
account to exceed a given number of pages, and he
was compelled to produce these ready cut and dried,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
at a period specified. A writer of any taste, or
learning, or genius, disdains fetters of every kind,
and it may reasonably be questioned whether it is
not, after all, the wisest policy to leave the author,
at least, greater freedom in these particulars. Nobody
was more sensible of this than our great moralist
Johnson, who might, perhaps confiding in the
weight and value of his name, and yielding to his
constitutional indolence of temper, presume to require
somewhat too much of indulgence. Yet
when, on finishing the Lives of the Poets, he exclaimed,
“Now a fig for Mr. Nichols,” although
he loved Mr. Nichols, as indeed well he might, it
may be fairly questioned, whether there was not a
little inkling of tartness rising about the præcordia.
The interest of publishers ought, without doubt, to
have due consideration, and they, of course, are the
most adequate judges how far this is obstructed or
promoted by activity or delay on the part of authors.</p>

<p>But it is a question not altogether unworthy of
discussion, whether they sufficiently consult their
true and real interests, if by vexatious importunity
they intrude upon the sacred recesses of the scholar,
gathering the produce of his vineyard in a crude
and immature state, before a few more progressive
suns shall have mellowed it to ripeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>An honest bookseller surely deserves an appropriate
chapter. Let us then proceed to another,
honest also, nobody will deny, but marked by many
whimsical peculiarities of character.</p>

<p>The professional character who next comes
under review, is termed by the Sexagenarian, in
his notes, the Queer Bookseller. By the way, our
friend appears to have been irresolute in the usage
of the term professional. It has been erased, and
afterwards re-written, with a quere annexed. Whether
it should be exclusively confined to the higher
professions of the church, law, and medicine, may
admit of doubt, but that some limitation is necessary,
appears from the following anecdote.</p>

<p>A country cousin visited a relation in the metropolis
of some respectability, with the desire of soliciting
his aid and advice as to his views in life.
He was received by his relative with kindness,
who having elsewhere heard that the young man
was of a mechanic taste, and that he meditated
being a maker of watches, complimented him on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
his supposed talent, and was leading the conversation
to the subject of mechanism and the arts. The
youth, in high dudgeon, disdained the idea and
drudgery of a tradesman’s life, and interrupted his
relative by exclaiming, What, Sir, do you think me
a tradesman?</p>

<p>Why I must confess that such a suggestion had
been communicated to me.</p>

<p>No, Sir, you need not be ashamed of your relationship;
I am not a tradesman; I am a Professor
of Dancing; which being interpreted, was found to
mean neither more nor less than a Country dancing
master.</p>

<p>Fortunate was it for the old gentleman and his
wife, that this eclaircissement took place in the
evening, for on the morning following, they were
awakened at an early hour by a most unaccountable
noise in the chamber above that in which they
slept, which would greatly have annoyed them, had
they not conjectured, what in reality proved to be
the fact, that their country cousin was practising
the last new waltz, with one of the bed-room
chairs.</p>

<p>But to return to our Queer Bookseller. The
epithet is not intended to express the smallest disrespect,
but the person in question was characterized
by a dryness of manner peculiarly his own.
He was seldom betrayed into a smile, nor did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span> he
ever appear particularly exhilarated, even when the
greatest wits of the day assembled at his house. He
had to boast of the familiar acquaintance of Wilkes
and Boswell, and Johnson and Cumberland, and
Parr and Steevens, and a numerous tribe of popular
writers. No one could exercise the rites of hospitality
with greater liberality, and when enabled
from success, to retire from the world with great
opulence, he retained his kind feelings towards
those, who had formerly been connected with him
as authors, and gave them a frequent and cordial
welcome at his table.</p>

<p>But to evince the powerful effect of habit, he
retained so strong a partiality for the situation in
which he had passed the greatest part of his life,
and where he had accumulated his wealth, that
though it was in the very noisiest part of the noisiest
street in the city, he invariably, and for ever afterwards,
made it the standard by which he estimated
how far any thing was handsome, convenient, or
agreeable. “My house in the city” comprised
every thing which was animating and delightful
without, and comfortable and exhilarating within.</p>

<p>With the dry manner above described, there was
united an extraordinary simplicity, which, where
this individual’s better qualities were not very well
known, frequently gave offence. Our friend had
never any intercourse with him on matters of business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
but once. In conjunction with a friend,
whose works are now under more solemn and awful
criticism elsewhere, he was prevailed upon to print
a book on speculation, presuming, which indeed
turned out to be the fact, that the booksellers would
subscribe for the impression. The dry bookseller
was, among others, applied to, but he returned the
letter of application to the writer, simply writing
under it, A. B. will not subscribe.</p>

<p>Upon another occasion an author who lived at
a distance from the metropolis, at that period a
great patriot, and flaming politician, had written a
book of biography, the sale of which was to pour
unheard-of riches into his bosom; guineas, for it
was then the time of guineas, glittered in brilliant
heaps before his warmed imagination. He employed
a common friend to entreat the interposition
of the Sexagenarian with some publisher, as being
better acquainted with the nature of such negociations.</p>

<p>The office was readily accepted, and this same
Queer gentleman was the person fixed upon to become
the purchaser of the copy-right of this inestimable
treasure. A meeting was appointed, the circumstances
explained, the copy produced, was cast
off, and agreed to be comprised in an octavo volume.
Then succeeded the anxious moment of expectation
of the reply to be given to, “How much will you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
advance for the copy-right?”</p>

<p>The author had doubtless heard of the large
sums given per volume to Gibbon, Robertson,
Blair, Beattie, and other writers of that calibre;
and though perhaps neither his pride nor his ambition
carried his expectations quite so far as to suppose
that he should be placed on a parallel with
these illustrious names, yet his disappointment (and
disappointment is always in proportion to the hopes
indulged) cannot easily be described, when, in a
dry, grave, and inflexible, tone, he heard the words
“Twenty pounds and six copies.”</p>

<p>Thus was the flattering hope of authorship nipped
in the bud; the labour of many successive months,
in a moment rendered unavailing, and the fond
dreams of fame and emolument made to vanish as
by the wand of a sorcerer.</p>

<p>There are sundry other booksellers upon our list;
for example, the Splendid Bookseller, the Cunning
Bookseller, the Black Letter Bookseller, the Comical
Bookseller, the Dirty Bookseller, the Fine
Bookseller, the Unfortunate Bookseller, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Splendid Bookseller, by patient and persevering
frugality, with high connections, which
seemed entailed upon his house, was enabled to
retire to tranquillity and independence, long before
the decline of life, or infirmities of age, rendered it
necessary to do so. He was highly respectable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
but could drive a hard bargain with a poor author,
as well as any of his fraternity.</p>

<p>The Cunning Bookseller lived within a hundred
miles of the preceding personage, but in pursuit of
the main chance, would condescend to do, what his
neighbour would have disdained. He would attend
in person at the little auctions in the metropolis
and its environs, where effects were distrained for
rent or taxes, but among which, by chance, some
less common books had found their way. In making
a bargain with an author, he was dry and cold, and
hard and sharp, as flint. He had also another way
of getting on. If he saw those who frequented his
shop, and whose means he knew to be less abundant,
express any earnestness of curiosity about
either his own publications, or books newly imported
or published, he would, with great apparent
civility, encourage them to become purchasers, by
observing, that he should not be in a hurry to call
for payment. But alas! the poor wights hardly
had time to peruse their new acquisitions, before
this sharp-faced dealer and chapman would call for
a settlement, and either urge the having a bill at
short date given him, or would provoke the pride of
the poor scholar to part with other books, dear perhaps
as the apple of his eye, to cancel the debt and
get rid of his importunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>By such modes of conduct, and by extraordinary
success in various publications, and in one more
particularly, he accumulated very large property,
and retired. After his retirement, however, the
“<i>auri sacra fames</i>” still continued to agitate him,
nor had he entirely got the better of this infirmity,
when death called upon him finally to settle all his
accounts at once.</p>

<p>The Black Letter Bookseller was also somewhat
of a singular character in his way, and in
his day. He was a perfect master of his business,
and of that part of it more immediately which related
to the earlier productions of the English
press. He was, moreover, acute, active, and
obliging.</p>

<p>It was in his time that old English books, of a
particular description both in prose and verse,
were, from some cause or other, principally perhaps
as they were of use in the illustration of Shakespeare,
beginning to assume a new dignity and importance,
and to increase in value at the rate of
five hundred per cent. Tracts which for a long
preceding interval, produced no more than eighteen-pence,
now began to sell for more than as many
shillings. This rage often extended to the whimsical
titles, which it was the fashion of our forefathers
to prefix to their publications; and it may
perhaps be said truly of most of them, that in this,
and this only, their principal value consisted. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
must be allowed, that ingenuity must frequently
have been put to the full stretch, to have devised
such appellations as the following.</p>

<p>Hoplocrisma Spongus; or, a Sponge to wipe
away the Weapon Salve. 1631.</p>

<p>An answer to this was published with the title
of the Squeezing of Parson Foster’s Sponge. 1631.</p>

<p>Niobe dissolved into a Violin, or his Age
drowned in his own Tears.</p>

<p>These are a few quaint things taken at hazard
out of the Black Letter Bookseller’s catalogue;
and it may be further observed on the subject,
that all the books by Nash, Green, Withers, &amp;c.
then becoming very dear and rare, were distinguished
by similarly eccentric appellations. Our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
Bookseller, with great sagacity and diligence,
availed himself of the prevailing phantasy, and thus
laid the foundation of emoluments which he did not
live to enjoy.</p>

<p>A whimsical anecdote of this personage will serve
to illustrate the temper of the times, as demonstrated
among us at the commencement of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>On the murder of the unfortunate King of France,
the Sexagenarian wrote a pamphlet, which he entitled
“Brief Memoirs of the Chief of the French
Regicides,” for which at that time he had access
to curious and authentic documents. He offered
it to the Black Letter Bookseller and his partner,
who accepted it, paid the sum agreed upon, and
advertised it for sale on a certain day.</p>

<p>A short time, however, before this day arrived,
the more active of the partners called upon the
author, and informed him, that they should feel
themselves much obliged if he would change the
title-page of the intended pamphlet. Our friend
expressed great surprise, and desired an explanation
of the motives which induced such a request.
The reply was to this effect:—That it was hardly
possible then to foresee how matters would ultimately
turn out; that they had among their best
customers individuals of <span class="smcap">strong</span> political opinions,
who might hereafter take great offence at their publishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
a pamphlet with such a title. The author,
who was loyal to the very core, endeavoured to
argue and remonstrate, but all in vain. A new
title was prefixed, the old one at some expence
cancelled, and the brochure made its appearance
with the more harmless and less offensive inscription
of “Brief Memoirs of the Leaders of the
French Revolution.” A large impression was very
soon sold.</p>

<p>The scrupulous feelings on matters which regarded
politics, rather increased than diminished
on the part of this house. The author afterwards
composed a waggish sort of parody, or rather commentary,
on Paine’s Rights of Man, in which many
of that writer’s doctrines and positions were turned
to ridicule. He offered it to the Black Letter Bookseller,
who ingenuously acknowledged that such was
the spirit of the times, as to compel him to decline
being the publisher of any works of a political tendency.</p>

<p>We have now to introduce a Bookseller of a
very singular description, who in our notes is termed
the Exotic Bookseller. He was the introducer
of a new æra in the profession of which he was
so successful a member, and the anecdotes of his
rise, from a humble station to great opulence, and
to a familiar communication with the noble and the
great, would of themselves form a very interesting
and entertaining narrative. Equidem plura audivi
quam credo, sed nec affirmare sustineo de quibus
dubito, nec subducere quæ accepi.</p>

<p>His father honourably and successfully pursued
the occupation, which descended to the son, in a
remote provincial town, and had deservedly obtained
great reputation from the elegance and neatness
of his bindings. If the intelligence received by
the Sexagenarian be not fallacious, he was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
inventor of the art of painting landscapes on the
edges of the external leaves of a book, which only
became visible when unfolded to a certain distance.</p>

<p>Be the above as it may, the son was the first
person who professedly displayed in the metropolis
shelves of valuable books in splendid bindings, and
having taken a large house in one of the most frequented
and fashionable streets, it soon became the
resort of the gay morning loungers of both sexes.
At the same time also invitation was held out to
students and scholars, and persons of real taste, from
the opportunity of seeing and examining the most
curious and rare books, manuscripts, and missals.</p>

<p>His success at home of itself seemed sufficient to
satisfy any ordinary speculator in this sort of commerce,
but this was not enough for the personage
of whom we are speaking. He determined to make
a circuit of Europe, and proceeding from his native
island with abundance of money, great acuteness,
the most intimate and familiar acquaintance with
the objects of his research, and above all, choosing
the most auspicious moment for his purpose, when
by following the rear of the French armies, he
might on easy terms obtain his choice of what he
most wanted, he had abundant cause on his return
to felicitate himself on his success. Other speculations
also connected with his profession, proved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
alike fortunate, and ere long elevated the subject
of these remarks to considerable distinction and
opulence. He became a sort of literary oracle,
and was consulted by the grave and the gay, the
lively and severe, the scholar and the sciolist; and
truth to say, his manner was so inimitably fine,
that he had as much to say on an illuminated missal,
and an Etruscan vase, as on the books printed
at the Sabiaco monastery, or the Florence Homer
of 1488.</p>

<p>The solemn hour of retirement from the world
at length approached, that crisis of such rare occurrence,
when the votary of wealth exclaims with
sincerity, “Have I not enough?” Mr. ⸺
married, and became a country gentleman. Many
whimsical stories are to be found in books, which
detail particular cases of hypochondriacal and nervous
disorders, of men who having been occupied
in the vigorous part of life in active business, have
found retirement from employment not only tedious
and uncomfortable, but exceedingly painful.</p>

<p>One is recorded of a great shoemaker, who
purchased a villa upon Blackheath, to which he
retired with great exultation and delightful views
of promised pleasure. A summer-house was to
be erected, in which our friends from Aldgate were
to enjoy their refreshing pipes; fruit-trees of every
kind were to be planted; the flag held out on Sundays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
as a signal of welcome to all old acquaintances
passing that way; politics discussed, and the
nation saved from almost irretrievable ruin. Alas!
alas! how soon a thing when once in our possession,
loses its lustre, its beauty, and its value.
After the short experiment of a few months, Mr.
Last began to think that something was the matter
with him, though he did not know exactly what.
The walk on the heath lost its interest, the views
from Greenwich-hill ceased to delight, the appetite
was not so good, sleep was broken, and a general
low-spiritedness ensued, which began to wear a
formidable appearance.</p>

<p>A celebrated physician was sent for from the
metropolis. His sagacity soon found out the cause
of the malady, and prescribed a simple but certain
remedy. It appeared evident to the medical gentleman,
that the mischief originated in the privation
of those employments for which the mind of the
patient was so constituted, as to be not only the
best, but alone adapted. After a minute enquiry
into what hands the business, so inauspiciously
quitted, had fallen, and ascertaining the practicability
of the patient’s being thankfully welcomed as
an occasional visitor, to give the benefit of his advice
and experience, it was determined that he was
regularly to go to town by the stage three times a
week, to assist in “cutting out.” The experiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
succeeded, and health and cheerfulness were
restored.</p>

<p>It is by no means intended to insinuate, that our
retired bookseller became a victim of similar infirmities,
or if he had the propensity to imbibe the
miasma, he took care to guard against its pernicious
effects. He continued now and then, at intervals,
by way of amusement, and at the desire of friends,
to dabble a little in the way of his former occupation,
and was said, on some critical occasion, to
have made a trip to the Continent, partly on the
account of declining health, and partly to avail himself
of a tempting opportunity to pick and choose,
from a very select collection of rare things <i>in his
way</i>.</p>

<p>Who shall pretend to say that there was any
harm in all this? But does it not serve to verify
the old and homely proverb, “What is bred in
the bone is never out of the flesh?” And does it
not tend to prove the almost impossibility of blending
the love of gain, inherent in a tradesman, with
the disregard of it, which is the proud distinction
of the gentleman?</p>

<p>As to external manners, the person in question
was both courteous and courtier-like. They who
were less favourably inclined towards him, complained
that his enunciation was affectedly soft,
and that he had too much of the air and grimace of
a Frenchman; and by the shrug of his shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
and his facility in speaking the language, has more
than once been mistaken for a native of that
country. But his peculiarities were harmless, his
knowledge of all the mysteries of his craft, more
extensive, perhaps, than that of any of his contemporaries,
his merits considerable, and death might
easily have spared a less amiable character.</p>

<p>The few remaining scraps on the subject of
booksellers may be summarily brought together.
There is some account of a Snuffy Bookseller,
a man of great singularity of life and manners.
He had a university education originally, with a
view of taking orders. Why he changed his purpose
is unknown. It has been whispered that an
eminent female personage, long since deceased, to
whom he had been useful in collecting and arranging
books of prints and engravings, had promised
to procure him preferment. His next occupation
was that of an engraver, in which art he became
no mean proficient. His final employment was
that of a bookseller, in which mystery also he had
obtained no inconsiderable degree of knowledge.
The last fatal catastrophe of his life was truly lamentable,
occasioned in all probability from disappointed
hopes, and the horrors of approaching
penury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>There was also a bookseller to whom the epithet
of B⸺d is attached, but anecdotes of vulgar
rudeness, over-reaching cunning, and total disregard
of the civilities of life, would only deform
these pages.</p>

<p>Some remarks are also to be found on a Cunning
Bookseller, who, at a very early period of life, had
obtained the most extensive knowledge of his business
in all its branches, which he did not fail to
turn to good account.</p>

<p>Attention also is invited to a sketch of a Godly
Bookseller, a worthy and conscientious man, whose
principal dealings were in religious books and
tracts, and chief correspondence with individuals
of that description.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there are some not unentertaining
notices of a Superb Bookseller. This personage
seems not altogether to have disdained genius in
its humbler garb and more retired walks, yet the
whole of his establishment, his mansion, his furniture,
his symposia, seemed intended for the noble
and the great alone. A great and popular house,
he was well aware, would at any time sell a considerable
impression of any thing. On such occasions
he was splendidly liberal; and as theatrical
managers, when they get up a new play, are careless
of the expence of decorations, dresses, and
scenery, so would our Superb Bookseller give a
great and noble author every advantage of the
finest wire-wove paper and Bulmer’s typography,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
He nevertheless had the character of a disposition
to drive a hard bargain with such authors as were
untitled, unbeneficed, (or if it may be permitted to
coin a word) unincomed. He is said to have laboured
under the imputation of having sacrificed
at the shrine of <i>greater</i> friends, it may not be said
on the score of lucre, the claims of an individual,
whose worth, talents, and amiable manners, had
been long known and acknowledged by continued
experience of their value. He was accused of
having sanctioned, at least by his connivance, an
<i>ex post facto</i> attack, written in all the gall of bitterness,
and dictated by personal spleen, rather
than by an ingenuous spirit of fair criticism, upon
a work of great labour and merit, which has hitherto
stood, and will continue to stand, the test
of time.</p>

<p>Here our manuscript seems brought to a conclusion,
for after a few desultory hints, of which
some are perfectly unintelligible to the Editor, the
following quotation occurs in a larger hand-writing.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of the pieces which follow

Those which are not so, were either written
from his personal dictation, or copied by his permission.</p>

<p>The subjoined is, perhaps, the earliest specimen
of Porson’s Latinity which has hitherto appeared.
The Proemium to the Notes, which, at the request of

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Maii 29ᵒ 1784.</span></p>

<p>Quamvis super Caroli secundi meritis hodie privatorum
hominum multæ sint et discrepantes sententiæ,
tamen si publicum istius sæculi Ecclesiæ totiusq;
populi suffragium respicimus, hunc diem non
modo cretâ notandum sed et dignum judicabimus,
qui solenni gratiarum actione quotannis celebretur.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
Et cum nulla neq; lex neq; consuetudo altius radices
agat, aut diutius floreat, quam quæ religionis nomen
prætendat; operæ pretium sit propius inspicere
et exigere Caroli mores atq; ingenium; sine
irâ et studio inquirere, quantum reipublicæ contulerit;
quibus sive privatim sive publice virtutibus
eminuerit; quantis libertatem et religionem beneficiis
auxerit; quam bene denique cum regis tum hominis
partes impleverit.</p>

<p>Si qui rex unquam fuit, qui optimis et
felicissimis avibus regnum suum auspicatus est,
is profectò fuit Carolus, qui tanto tamq; unanimi
totius imperii consensu, in solium hæreditarium
escenderit. Et quemadmodum amantium iræ
(aiunt) amoris integratio est, quicquid in Carolum
patrem populus deliquerat, aut quodcunq; in
officio erga eum fungendo desiderari potuerat, id
omne effusissimâ est, quâ filium prosequebatur
benevolentiâ pensare aut supplere adnixus. Qui
per tot annos sub crudelis et suspicacis tyranni
dominatione gemuissent, expectatione melioris fortunæ
nunc se consolabantur, si princeps ab exilio
revocaretur; satiusq; duxerunt, etiam si tyranni
potestatem iterum experiri necesse esset, ejus arbitrium
agnoscere, ad quem lege hereditariæ successionis
regnandi jus aliquatenus pertinere videretur.
Cromwello igitur tandem mortuo, omnes sectæ et
factiones certatim se regi restituendo accinxêre.
Sperabant scilicet, fore, ut novus rex, quantum patriæ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
favori deberet, gratus memoriæ mandaret, et
aliquando tam re quam verbis ostenderet; ut patris
sui miserabili fortunâ et immaturo exitu admonitus,
scopulos et syrtes in quas ille impegisset, ipse
gubernator factus, cautâ et prudenti navigatione
evitaret; ut neq; communia jura deminueret, neq;
præter jus fasq; prærogativæ suæ fines propagaret;
ut adversis rebus diu multumq; conflictatus, humanè
et sine insolenti lætitiâ secundis frueretur.</p>

<p>His freti cogationibus regni hæreditatem stabilem
et perpetuam videntur reddidisse; tantamq; vectigalium
partem regiis sumptibus suppeditandis destinâsse,
quanta magni principis splendori et dignitati
non solum tutandæ, sed etiam ostentandæ sufficeret.
Neq; de suo tantum largiti sunt, quippe qui hæc
præclara propensæ in regem voluntatis argumenta
ediderint, ne minimâ quidem conditionum ab ipso
servandarum mentione factâ. Adeo enixe studium,
suum et obedientiam probare aggressi sunt, ut quid
majorum suorum memoriæ, quid sibi ipsi, quid
posteritati deberent, pariter obliti essent. Sed ne
quicquam requiri posset, quo se regi dicto audientes
et morigeros præberent, iidem homines penes quos
potissimum restituti regis gloria esset, totius gentis
personâ susceptâ perduellionis erga beatum (quem
vocabant) martyrem se ipse reos profitebantur et
admissi facinoris a clementissimo domino veniam
impetrabant. Non tamen rex eo usq; clementiâ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
suâ abusus est, ut neminem omnino veniâ indignum
judicaret, sed lenitatem suam justâ severitate temperavit,
in eosq; judices qui ex animi sententiâ et
quoniam è rep. fore censuerunt, patrem suum capitis
damnâssent, omnibus exemplis animadvertendum
statuit. Qui autem temporis causâ hoc parricidium
perpetrâssent, iis quod sibi videretur fidelibus
consiliorum suorum ministris olim usurus,
generosâ et sapienti sententiâ pœnam condonavit.
Sed ut quod sentio liberè et sine ambagibus dicam;
fatendum est ab iis quorum affectus in neutram partem
proclivior est, contra regiam dignitatem, contra
civilem prudentiam peccâsse Carolum, quod non præteritorum
omnium facinorum memoriam penitus aboleret.
Sin autem hoc fautores Stewartorum negabunt;
illud certè non negabunt (neq; enim vel possunt vel
audent;) suppliciorum qua a perduellibus leges exigunt,
crudeliorem partem, utpote exempli parum memoris
legum humanarum, remitti oportuisse.</p>

<p>Quanquam autem, ut supra demonstravimus,
quod satis superq; esset frugali regiæ donâsset, tamen
ut amoris quo novum regem amabant, locupletissimum
darent testimonium, plures extraordinarias
pensiones in ipsius fratrisq; loculos contulerunt. Ac
nè quid deesset quod civium bene sentientium animos
indicaret, decreto incertum magis ridiculo an absurdo,
omnia quæ Senatus aut Cromwellus per viginti
annos egerant, abrogabantur. Si historici hujus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
temporis audiendi sunt, hæc flagitia quodammodo
excusari possunt, propterea quod ab ebriis ferè et
discinctis nebulonibus admissa essent, quanquam
facilitas ea, quæ hujusmodi homines in supremum
pene gentis concilium adsciverit, non omnino laudanda
videtur.</p>

<p>Est et alia res, levicula quidem illa, neq; tamen
prorsus negligenda, cædis nempe cupido quædam
et aviditas, quâ per totum regni tempus
Carolus tam vehementur flagravit, ut vix suspicari
possis in genitâ ejus crudelitate factum ut tot
innocentes homines contra leges sanctas et jura
imo interdum contra ipsius pollicitationes capite
plecterentur. Verisimilius videtur talia spectacula
huic principi ludi jociq; instar fuisse. Neq; equidem
valdè miror, si Carolus, qui Galliæ sæpe vidisset,
quantâ ibi facilitate rex morte, exilio, aut
bonorum publicatione cives afficiat, quemq; Angli
non minori adulatione, quam Galli Ludovicum
mulcere solerent, regis Gallici potestatem in hâc
quoq; parte usurpare vellet. Certè nisi pondus
aliquod his excusationibus subesse concedamus,
agnoscendum erit vix quicquam in omni historiâ,
quod ab humanitate alienius sit de pessimis et odiosissimis
tyrannis narrari, neq; quod ab omni lenitate
et prudentià, ut legum violationem omittam, magis
abhorreat. Inter nobiles hujus temporis reos, Vanius,
Russelius et Sidneius præcipuè eminent, quorum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
injusta et crudelis mors Caroli memoriæ æternam
dedecoris atq; intamiæ notam inuret. Si
horum exemplorum atrocitatem eâ quâ par est,
indignatione contemplabimur, Tiberii alterius aut
Neronis scelera legere videbimur.</p>

<p>Quod si de domestica rerum administratione nihil
quod quereremur, haberemus, bellorum à Carolo
gestorum et fœderum ictorum tanta est ignominia,
quantam vix Joannes noster suscepit cum a Pontifice
Romano coronam precario acciperet. Misso primum
contra Belgas, a quibus magnificentissimo fuerat hospitio
exceptus, exercitu, avaræ et ingratæ mentis justissimas
pœnas persolvit. Cum enim res Belgarum
superior evasisset, iniquis Carolus est pacis conditionibus
acquiescere coactus. Ut bellum gereret,
spoliorum cupiditas, si verum amamus, primo regem
pepulerat, quam non frustatus est eventus. Quamvis
enim ex Belgio Fœderato nihil præter dedecus,
reportaret, pecuniam quam in sumptus belli erogandam
civium liberalitas dedisset, in rem suam
ipse catus convertit. Multa vero delicta, quæ in
alio quovis flagitia essent, ut in Carolo leviore
nomine notentur, facit præcipuorum ejus facinorum
magnitudo; quorum in numero principem locum
merito obtinet, quod duo maxima totius imperii
robora et firmamenta, Dunquercam et Tingen
hosti turpiter prodiderit. Illud autem consilium
palmam cœteris præripit, quod inter eum et Ludovicum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
mercenariis conditionibus convenerat.</p>

<p>Satis jam notum est regem clam se eidem religionis
sectæ, cui fratrem Jacobum, Romanæ nempe,
addixisse: Hanc quoq; per Britanniam, Ludovici
auxilio, ubicunq; tempus sineret, propagare, veterem
constitutionem delere, pro libertate tyrannidem,
pro reformatâ religione, Catholicam invehere decreverat.
Sed tam timide gelideq; hanc rem ministravit,
tantâ solertiâ dicam an malitiâ, animi cogitata
celavit, ut multis Catholicorum gravissimis
suppliciis afficerentur, ipso rege, qui eandem fidem
amplexus erat, approbante.</p>

<p>Hæc pauca ex innumeris publicarum Caroli virtutum
exempla selegimus. Videamus si privati mores
cæteros defectus compensent. Etiam pater ejus, regni
errores cæteris virtutibus partim redemit. Sed in hâc
parte valdè dissimilem et degenerem filium reliquit.
Vix ullam Europæ regionem peragravit, quin ex eâ
novas ineptias, nova vitia reportaret. Avus ejus
Jacobus ab adulatoribus suis appellari solitus est
Salomon secundus. Quæ una res ei defuit ad perfectam
similitudinem Carolus supplevit, quem nemo
Salomonis simillimum fuisse negabit, qui immensum
utriusq; concubinarum numerum reputaverit. Cum
hujusmodi mulierculis et viris non honestioribus
otium suum omni luxus et libidinis genere oblectavit.
Qualis vir fuisset, indicio fuerunt, (ut quidam
non ineptè observavit) ultima ejus extremâ in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
morte verba, quibus neq; reip. neq; amicorum cujus
aut propinquorum, sed meretricis meminerat. At
forsan, inquies, opum suarum facultatibus ad patris
suiq; comitum et defensorum inopiam sublevandam
usus est, et hanc occasionem testandi quam bene
adversus omne qui alterius utrius causam fortunis,
manu, scriptis adjuvissent, avidè arripuit. Nihil
minus; fidelissimos regiæ potestatis servos aut
neglexit, ut inter mille alios Couleium et Butlerum
nominem, aut, sicut Clarendonum, à se et patriâ
removit, exiliiq; periculis et laboribus objecit.</p>

<p>Qui omnes nervos contendunt, ut Caroli memoriam
qua jure qua injuriâ aliquatenus ab infamiâ
quâ premitur liberent, regis comitatem atq; hilaritatem
prædicant; quamq; facetus et lepidus conviva
esset, libenter narrant. Et sanè disertus fuit leporum
et facetiarum, si modo pro leporibus et facetiis
scurrilis dicacitas sumatur. Hujus enim uberrimâ
abundabat copiâ; nihil unquam facetè dixit, quod
salvo pudore; nec liberè, quod salvâ religione dici
posset. Per totum hujus principis regnum, modestiæ,
pudoris, sinceritatis, temperantiæ, religionis
deniq; nulla habita est ratio; neq; certior aut expeditior
ad regis favorem patebat aditus, quam si
quis, scurra, impius, vinosus et prodigus audiret.
Ut quisq; ipse erat simillimus, ita carissimus.
Ut breviter absolvam, antequam coronam adeptus
esset, mendicus fuit; postquam adeptus esset, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>rex
non fuit: sine dignitate sapientiâ aut fortitudine;
sine amicitiâ; sine fide et amore connubiali; sine
fraternâ pietate, atheus vivebat, Papista moriebatur.
Talis fuit Carolus secundus.</p>

Ego sane, nisi <span class="smcap">Toupii</span> ingenium et doctrinam

<p>The subjoined are specimens of Porson’s familiar
Letters. The person to whom they were addressed
negotiated, at Porson’s desire, with the bookseller,
for the publication of the Letters to Travis. It is
correctly stated in the Athenæum that the prize
given was thirty pounds. That the publisher lost
money by it can hardly be conceived. The book
is now out of print and numbered among the scarcer
books.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Dear ⸺</p>

<p>Settle the matter of publication for me in any
way that you think reasonable, or that would be
satisfactory to yourself. If you agree upon the
terms that you mention in your letter, inform me
when they would wish to begin. For, as the Preface
will of course be printed last, I could send
them a copy of the Letters in the Magazine, properly
corrected, within a few days. With respect
to the Lay Fellowship, I thank you for the information,
but if it is already vacant, you need not doubt
of its being given away. If you see the Rev. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
W. tell him the same from me, which will be equivalent
to an acknowledgement of his letter, and tell
him besides that Mr. Goodall is extremely flattered
by the attention of a person so much his superior
in dignity: συγκαθημενων, I would render the women
who live with him. The literal sense is, without
doubt, “who sit together;” but this expression
refers to what was generally the case, not what was
the case in this particular instance, for we are informed
that it was quite the contrary. See Dorville
on Chariton, which I have not by me here.</p>

<p>The Clergyman alluded to in the above Letter,
was the Rev. Dr. Wingfield, for a time head master
of Westminster School, and since that period,
Prebendary of Worcester, with whom Porson subsequently
spent a great deal of his time. Mr.
Goodall is the present worthy Provost of Eton
College.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear ⸺</p>

<p>I think you may tell Mr. Egerton that I accept
his proposals, which appear to me liberal enough.
I find upon a review of my Letters in the Magazine,
that besides changing the form of the Address,
I shall make several alterations and additions that
will render it necessary for me to write the whole
over again. I shall return to London some time
next week with the first part, fairly written for the
press. I suppose that will be time enough. Συγκατημένων
is Ionic, as κατιεις for καθιεις, &amp;c. Your

as before, will come safe.</p>

<p>There are two things obvious from the above
short Epistle, namely, that the Professor did not
accustom himself to overrate the value of his
talents, and that he was ready, at all times, to communicate,
to those who required it, the benefit of
his superior erudition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Dear ⸺</p>

<p>I wrote to you last Monday, but as I suppose my
Letter might miscarry, I shall repeat the substance
of it. I authorized you to accept Mr. Egerton’s
terms; to which I shall only add, what I then
omitted through haste, a request that you would
stickle for half a dozen copies to be thrown into the
bargain. As I am obliged to write over all my
Letters that have been printed, to prevent mistakes
and confusion, I cannot let them have any part of
the copy before next week, when I expect to have
the pleasure of seeing you and ⸺ in town, to
whom present my compliments, and believe me to
be</p>

<p>Porson one day visiting his brother-in-law Mr.
P⸺, who at that time lived in Lancaster-court,
in the Strand, found him indisposed, and under the
influence of medicine. On returning to the house
of a common friend, he of course expected to be
asked after the health of his relation. After waiting
with philosophic patience, without the expected
questions being proposed, he reproached the company
for not giving him an opportunity of giving
the following answer, which he had composed on
his walk.</p>

<h4>ON THE POPULAR PLAY OF PIZARRO.</h4>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As I walked through the Strand so careless and gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I met a young girl who was wheeling a barrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Choice fruit, Sir, said she, and a bill of the play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So my apples I bought, and set off for Pizarro.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When I got to the door, I was squeezed, and cried dear me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I wonder they made the entrance so narrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At last I got in, and found every one near me</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was busily talking of Mr. Pizarro.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo! the hero appears, what a strut and a stride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He might easily pass for a Marshal to-morrow,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Come play up a jig, and a fig for Pizarro.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">His boots were much neater than those of Pizarro.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then the priestess and virgins, in robes white and flowing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Walked solemnly on like a sow and her farrow,</div>

<p>Porson’s fondness for Algebra was universally
known, but perhaps a more singular proof of this
can hardly be adduced than is exhibited in the following
equation, composed by him in Greek. The
original is comprized in one line.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Required the number, which being divided into two unequal
parts, the square of the greater added to the less shall be
equal to the square of the less added to the greater. Let
the numbers be <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.</p>

<p>The following specimens of good-natured levity
and humour were also produced by him, without
any study or previous meditation.</p>

<p>The little girl, who was his favourite, as has before
been mentioned, one day led him by the hand
into the kitchen, to deliver a message to a servant.
A young woman who had lived long in
the family, and was much respected, was ironing
linen. Her name was Susan, and the child desired
Porson to write some verses upon her. Porson,
as soon as he returned to the parlour, pronounced
the following lines.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When lovely Susan irons smocks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No damsel ere looked neater,</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>On the extravagant terms of flattery, which Mr.
Hayley and Miss Seward used in compliments to
one another, Porson frequently indulged much satirical
observation. The following dialogue is supposed
to take place between the parties.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that Porson wrote some
notes for Nicholson, to be prefixed to the edition of
Xenophon’s Anabasis, published at Cambridge, in
1786. One of the copies of that work, given him
by the bookseller, he presented to the writer of this
article, with an inscription in Latin, written in his
most beautiful manner, and expressed in the most
flattering terms. A great many years afterwards
he happened to take this particular Volume into his
hands, and on looking at the inscription, hastily tore
it out, promising the owner to write another. He
never could be prevailed upon to explain his motive
for this act, but it was conceived that some particular
form of expression or disposition of the words
had appeared erroneous to his better judgment.
His friendly sentiments were certainly unchanged,
which he manifested by subsequently writing another
inscription in the book, expressed in terms, to
the full as flattering as those which preceded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span> The
words were these.</p>

<p class="center">Viro doctissimo<br>
atque<br>
Amicissimo</p>

<p class="center">Amicitiæ<br>
Ergo<br>
Donat.<br>
<span class="smcap">Ricardus Porson.</span><br>
1789.</p>

<p>That he was friendly and social, many examples
have already been adduced, sufficiently strong and
numerous to prove that Gilbert Wakefield’s application
to him of the term “Misanthrope” was
absurd and unjust. But he was occasionally very
playful, and once in a very merry mood, being in
company with the young lady, of whom we have
before spoken, and for whom he wrote most of
the Charades, (printed in this work) he offered a
trifling wager, that he could carry her round the
room in his teeth. This was accordingly accepted.
He fixed a handkerchief round her waist, and by
first obtaining a nice balance he actually accomplished
his purpose, without any seeming inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p>Upon the tendency of his politics it is not intended
to expatiate. It never interrupted an harmonious
intercourse of more than twenty years with
him, who pays this tribute to his memory, and to
whom, in a moment of confidence, he gave, in his
own hand-writing, a Pamphlet written in answer
to Mr. Burke’s Reflections on the French Revolution.
It is termed, A new Catechism for the
use of the Natives of Hampshire. It is written
with much vivacity and humour, but strongly marks
the incorrigible bitterness of his political prejudices.</p>

<p>The humour of the Tract consists in playing upon
the expression of the Swinish Multitude, said to
have been applied by Burke to the common people.
The beginning and conclusion are inserted as a
sufficient specimen.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Q.</i> What is your name?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> <i>Hog</i> or <i>Swine</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did God make you a <i>Hog</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No. God made me man in his own image;
the <i>Right Hon.</i> <span class="smcap">Sublime Beautiful</span> made me a
<i>Swine</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How did he make you a Swine?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> By muttering obscure and uncouth spells.
He is a dealer in the black art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Who feeds you?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Our Drivers, the only real <i>men</i> in this
<span class="smcap">County</span>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How many Hogs are you in all?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Seven or eight millions.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How many Drivers?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Two or three hundred thousand.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> With what do they feed you?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Generally with husks, swill, draff, malt,
grains, and now and then with a little barley-meal
and a few potatoes, and when they have too much
butter-milk themselves they give us some.</p>

</div>

<p>The following must be allowed not to be destitute
of humour.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Q.</i> What are the <i>Interpreters</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> called?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The <span class="smcap">Black Letter Sisterhood</span>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why do they give the office to women?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because they have a fluent tongue, and a
knack of scolding.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How are they are dressed?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In gowns and false hair.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What are the principal orders?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Three—<i>Writers</i>, <i>Talkers</i>, and <i>Hearers</i>, which
last are also called <i>Deciders</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is their general business?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To discuss the mutual quarrels of the hogs,
and to punish their affronts to any or all of the
drivers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If two hogs quarrel, how do they apply to
the sisterhood?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Each hog goes separately to a <i>Writer</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What does the <i>Writer</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> She goes to a <i>Talker</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What does the <i>Talker</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> She goes to a <i>Hearer</i> (or <i>Decider</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What does the <i>Hearer</i> decide?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> What she pleases.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If a hog is decided to be in the right, what is
the consequence?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He is <i>almost</i> ruined.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If in the <i>wrong</i>, what?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He is <i>quite</i> ruined.</p>

</div>

<p>After some facetious sneers at the clergy, who
are termed peace-makers, the dialogue proceeds.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Q.</i> How are these peace-makers rewarded?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> With our potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What with all?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Ten per cent. only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then you have still ninety left in the hundred?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, we have only forty left.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What becomes of the odd fifty?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The drivers take them, partly as a small recompence
for their trouble in protecting us, and
partly to make money of them, for the prosecution
of law-suits with the neighbouring farmers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> You talk very sensibly for a hog; whence
had you your information?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> From <i>a learned Pig</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The following is given by way of answer to the
question by what ceremony the hog is disenchanted,
and resumes his natural shape.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>A.</i> The hog that is going to be disenchanted,
grovels before the <i>Chief Driver</i>, who holds an iron
skewer over him, and gives him a smart blow on
the shoulder, to remind him at once of his former
subjection and future submission. Immediately he
starts up, like the devil from Ithuriel’s spear, in
his proper shape, and ever after goes about with a
nick-name. He then beats his hogs without mercy,
and when they implore his compassion, and beg
him to recollect that he was once their <i>Fellow
Swine</i>, he denies that ever he was a hog.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<p>This curious dialogue thus concludes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the general wish of the hogs at present?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To save their bacon.</p>

<p class="center">Chorus of hogs.</p>

<p class="center">Amen.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span></p>

<p>It may be observed of Porson, as Junius heretofore
remarked of himself, that perhaps his own
recollection could not always bring before him the
numerous things he had written at various times,
and on different occasions. Two learned articles
of great judgment and acute criticism, may be
pointed out, which not improbably Porson never
communicated, except to the individuals for whose
immediate service they were intended; more particularly
as those individuals proudly pursued and
sturdily avowed principles and sentiments, in the
most determined opposition to those with whom
the Professor lived with greater familiarity and intimacy.</p>

<p>The first of these was an article containing very
learned and ingenious observations on the Codex
Theodori Bezæ Cantabrigiensis, published by Dr.
Kipling in 1793.</p>

<p>The reader may remember, that this MS. was
so printed, that every page, line, word, letter, and
point, as far as types can imitate hand-writing, corresponded
with the original. Dr. Woide had done
the same thing before with respect to the celebrated
Alexandrian MS. But of the two works, the Professor
remarks, “that as much as Kipling’s work
is superior to Dr. Woide’s in its outside,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span> so does it
appear to be below it in intrinsic merit.”</p>

<p>The Professor objects, in the first instance, to
the title prefixed by Dr. Kipling, viz. Codex Theodori
Bezæ Cantabrigiensis. It is argued that an
ambiguity is here involved, and that the natural
construction of the words would make Bezæ, a
Cambridge man at least, if not a member of the
University. The whole, however, forms a fair and
candid specimen of criticism, though the writer
persists to the last in assigning the higher rank in
point of merit to Dr. Woide’s most valuable publication.</p>

<p>The other Critical Essay, to which the Professor
materially contributed, was a series of remarks
on Wakefield’s Lucretius. It could not
escape the discernment of so sagacious an observer
as Porson manifestly was, that even when performing
the office merely of editing a classical author,
Wakefield could not resist the impulse he always
obeyed of obtruding his opinions on subjects no
more connected with Lucretius than with the history
of China; and this has extorted the following
sentence, sharp enough it must be acknowledged,
but unquestionably true. “Mr. W.’s notes are very
numerous and various; philological, critical, illustrative,
and political, such as he always pours
forth with a facility which judgment sometimes
limps after in vain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span></p>

<p>It is well known to scholars, that the undertaking
of collating manuscripts is very far from being an
easy task, but in this labour the Professor was remarkably
well skilled. It will appear from the
observations here alluded to, that Porson actually
submitted to the drudgery of collating three of
the manuscripts employed by Wakefield. These
MSS. were as follows:—</p>

<p>A MS, belonging to the public library at Cambridge,
designated in Wakefield’s edition by the
Greek letter Ω.</p>

<p>A MS. belonging to Edward Poore, Esq. of no
great value or antiquity, referred to by Ο.</p>

<p>And three Harleian MSS. preserved in the British
Museum, respectively called in the edition
Δ. Π. Σ.</p>

<p>These three last MSS. being immediately within
his reach, the Professor carefully collated, and the
result of his conclusion was, that Wakefield cannot
receive the palm of a skilful and scrupulously accurate
collator. It is not intended to assert that the
passage which follows, came from Porson’s pen,
but it is so perfectly true in itself, and characteristic
of Wakefield, that it is here inserted.</p>

<p>“In thus examining the present Edition of Lucretius,
we feel a strong confidence that we shall not
be suspected of being actuated by any resentment
against a person, who must himself feel the chief
evils of a restless, impatient, intolerant, mind.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span> We
think it, indeed, most lamentable, that a man, whose
proper occupations are study and polite literature,
should be so little able to command himself, as to
fall into extravagances of political conduct, injurious
ultimately to himself and family. Too many instances
of this spirit appear completely out of their
places in this Edition of Lucretius, in the form of
political verses, allusions to the glories of France,
and aspirations after similar changes here, with
prophetic intimations of their approach.</p>

<p>“In such a farrago, abuse of us and our work,
as supporting all that Mr. W. wishes to see overthrown,
is virtually the highest compliment, and
though we owe no gratitude to the author, we cannot
but approve the tendency of his conduct towards
us.</p>

<p>“We see, however, in his pages not the slightest
tincture of that character, which he has, very early
in his Preface, bestowed upon himself. ‘Si quis
unquam diffidens mei.’ A most extravagant self-confidence,
on the contrary, is every where conspicuous,
except in a few of the prefatory flourishes;
and though his maturer judgment has enabled him
to see in his own ‘Silva critica plurima quæ sint
juveniliter temeraria απροσδιονυσα prorsus et homine
critico indigna,’ yet the very same character unimproved,
will be found to prevail in his critical conjectures,
scattered abundantly throughout the notes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
to his work, and readily accessible by means of his
critical index. No author escapes his rage for
correction, and Horace and Virgil in particular
would have as little knowledge of their own works,
were they presented to them reformed à la Wakefield,
as we should of the British constitution were
it given to his emendation. We can, however, pity
while we censure, and most sincerely wish that with
a more temperate mind, even in literature, he would
give himself exclusively, and without mixture, to
those studies, in which, with all his failings, he has
certainly made a proficiency not common among
scholars of this country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span></p>

<p>Whether the miscellaneous articles which follow
be worthy of insertion, may by some be doubted,
but they are genuine, and asperity may be softened
by the consideration that they are the last.</p>

<p>If the reader will refer to the edition of Demosthenes,
by Wolfius, printed at Frankfort, 1604, at
p. 470, he will find the Oration of Æschines contre
Ctesiphontem to conclude thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Και ειμεν καλως και αζιως του αδικηματος κατηγορηκα, ειπον
ως εβουλομην, ειδε ενδεεστερως ως εδυναμην.</p>

</div>

<p>Porson has noted a singular coincidence of expression
to be found in the 38th verse of the last
chapter of the second book of Maccabees.</p>

<p>“And if I have done well and as fitting the story
it is that which I desired, but if slenderly and
meanly, it is that which I could attain unto.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The character of Timon of Athens presents a
delineation of sudden change in the principles of
human action, which, though drawn by the pen of
Shakespeare himself, whose knowledge of the heart
appears almost intuitive, has been censured as
extravagant and unnatural. The glowing generosity,
the indefatigable friendship, the expansive
openness of soul, which mark the earlier features
of the character of Timon, are suddenly, on a
change of fortune, which discover treachery in his
supposed friends, subverted to their foundation.
The whole mental scene, shifting with rapidity and
violence, presents in their room the most inveterate
and ferocious detestation directed against all mankind.
In my mind, the poet has here only afforded
another proof of the keenness of that penetration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
which, glancing through all the springs and mazes
of the human soul, fixes the changing features of
the mental portrait, and holds a mirror to nature
herself. He perceived that on the ruins of our
best feelings the temple of misanthropy is ever
erected, the force of this truth he has exemplified
by characters stamped with the kindliest affections
of nature, containing those propensities on which
the fairest structure of human happiness is raised,
in which those benefits, so far from tending to their
proper end, ill-managed and abused, involve their
possessors in delusion and misery, and naturally
end in a frame of mind inimical to mankind, and
incapable of felicity.</p>

<p>Of these Timon is one; although inconsiderate
ostentation forms a striking feature in the delineation
of Shakespeare, the violence of misanthropy
is to be traced to other causes, and we are led to
exclaim, from a thorough knowledge of his character,
with the faithful Flavius,</p>

<p>To follow the general idea of the poet more
closely, to apply it more generally to human nature
at large, will probably reward our labour.
For this purpose, we may call up before our eyes
the painful, though too common picture, which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
mind, where the glow of fancy triumphs over reason,
and the mere impulse of sensibility supersedes
reflection and settled principle, exhibits in its progress
through the world.</p>

<p>To a mind of high wrought feelings, and heated
imagination, the entrance of life is fairy ground.
The objects which solicit attention, viewed through
the medium of that elevated hope which youth
alone inspires, shine with a brilliancy of tint not
their own. The face of universal nature impresses
the soul with secret influence, a delicious rapture,
which gives a new charm to being, and the heart,
intoxicated with its own sensations, expands with an
unbounded warmth to all existence.</p>

<p>The desert of the world is decorated with the
fleeting visions of a raised and glowing fancy, while
the eye rests, with unsuspicious wonder, on the
splendid prospects which the magic of early expectation
calls up on every side. Filled with that
strong enthusiasm which elevates whilst it deludes,
the mind soon is taught to feel, that in the crowd
of pleasures, which court her acceptance, something
is still deficient. The finer and more exalted ideas,
which stimulate incessantly to action, are still without
an object worthy of all their energy. The
powers of the soul languish, and are depressed,
from the narrowness of the sphere in which they
have yet moved, the master strings of the heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
are yet untouched, the higher, stronger passions of
the breast are to be rouzed before the keenness of
expectation can be gratified. The charms of friendship,
the delicate and intoxicating sensations which
attend the first delicious emotions of the tender
passion, rush on the imagination with violence,
to which even the energy of youthful ambition is
feeble and impotent in comparison. It seems that
but a dream of pleasure, a prospect of bliss, has
been presented to the view, which friendship and
love alone can realize and render perfect.</p>

<p>The enthusiast now looks eagerly around for the
objects, which a heart, yet unacquainted with the realities
of things, and wound up to its highest pitch, tells
him are alone able to fill that void which still aches
within the bosom. In the moment of delusion, the
connections are formed which are to stamp existence
with happiness or misery in the extreme. A
blind impulse overpowers deliberation, and the
heart expands itself for the reception of inmates,
whose value it has not for a moment paused to
ascertain. The measure of happiness is now for a
moment full. The mind, conscious that the energy
of sentiment no longer languishes in inaction, feels
those wishes compleated, which the vividity of imagination
had before but imperfectly suggested, and
yields without reserve to the novel emotions, which
begin to make part of its existence. On every side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
the heart is cheered by the smile of affection, on
every side the arms of friendship are expanded with
inviting openness.</p>

<p>The wand of deception creates a little world
around, where nothing meets the eye but the mutual
efforts of emulative exertion, and the smile of beneficence
exulting over its own work. And love!
sacred love! who that has truly felt thy first pure,
and delicious influence, but learns, even if the
object be delusion, that the few moments which thy
power can confer, are of more value than whole
existences unanimated by thy holy and vital flame.</p>

<p>But this rapture is not to last. The time is to
come when the prospect which depended on the
influence of passion, however noble, and prejudice,
however honest, shall melt away from the view.
The mind, raised to a pitch of enjoyment above the
reality of sublunary happiness, is in danger when
the faces of things appear at once in their proper
colours, of sinking to a degree equally below it.
He, who in the glow of his earlier feelings, feasted
his eye with increasing transport, on the gay and
captivating scenery, with which the creative power
of an ardent imagination had overspread the barrenness
of reality, now begins to find a thousand
little deceptions wear away. The insipidity and
nakedness of many an object, which, at a distance,
had attracted his eagerness, and roused the keenness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
of his passions, press so close upon him, that
even prejudice and enthusiasm fail to operate the
accustomed delusion.</p>

<p>The little vanity, so often interwoven with the
best natures, receives a variety of unexpected and
grievous wounds. As the mists which clouded his
better judgment retire, on every side he discovers
with astonishment, that a dupe to self-deception,
he has, like a blind idolator, fallen prostrate before
the gaudy images his own hands have formed and
decorated. He perceives that he has walked in a
world of his own creation, that life and man are
still before him to study, and he only recovers his
cooler reason to feel the loss of that mental elevation,
that brilliant perception of things, which,
though ideal, were so dear to him.</p>

<p>But perhaps this is not all, nor does the discovery
which scourges vanity, and detects the harmless fallacies
of judgment, alone await him. Perhaps the
hour of deception has treasured up disappointment
more heavy and intolerable. What are his sensations,
if the truth he now begins anxiously and fearfully
to learn, is brought immediately home to his own
bosom, and he is doomed to feel that the exalted
and glowing ideas of friendship, which first expanded
his soul, shrink even in his view, and leave
his breast void and desolate. When in the heart,
which his earliest ideas had imaged as the residence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
of that sacred passion, the trial of experience
detects hollowness and falsehood. When it is his
bitter lot to mark the progress of alienated affection,
to watch the subsidence of cooling attachment, to
feel the ties connected in an honest and unsuspicious
bosom with all his first enjoyments of happiness,
beginning one by one to untwine. When he
is to groan under the pang of the heart, which accompanies
the tearing out of the thousand little
habits of confidence, the innumerable kindly affections,
which long custom had rooted in the soul,
and made a part of the pleasantness of existence;
or when he is to experience the agony of the moment,
when he, in whom the bosom fondly trusted,
insults the confidence he has cruelly violated, and
aggravates by unfeeling mockery the distress his
perfidy has excited.</p>

<p>But if this can be borne, perhaps the last and
most fearful shock awaits him; the tenderest strings
of his soul are to be more cruelly rent, and the
wound, which before smarted almost to madness,
rendered at once incurable. There are finer and
more exalted ties, comprehending the best feelings,
the dearest relations of which our natures are capable.
Their severing is accompanied by sensations
to which the wound of violated friendship itself is
feeble, and, to minds of a certain frame, communicates
that deadly stroke, to which the power of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
other human evils, would have been inadequate.
Such are those which unexpected treachery, from
that quarter where the soul had gathered up its best
and tenderest hope, must call forth, and few are the
hearts, round the ruggedness of whose nature so
little of the softer feelings are entwined, as not to
feel the full keenness of that wound which the tearing
of the ties of love inflicts, though its firmness
had been inaccessible to the force of common calamities.
The distress is more complicated and
hopeless from its nature than any other, and the
pangs of a thousand discordant passions are
crouded and concentrated into that terrible moment
which discovers infidelity, where the confiding heart
had fondly rested all its prospects of happiness.
Under other strokes of calamity the soul gains
force and dignity from the greatness of unmerited
misfortunes, and rouses every latent power to combat
against evil fate.</p>

<p>In the school of distress the energies of the mind
are disclosed, and, learning our own powers, we
combat against the impression of adversity till we
are able to contemn it. But here the sufferer finds
himself as it were waked suddenly from a dream of
happiness to intolerable misery; with his mind unnerved
and weakened by passion, all the resources
of fortitude lying dormant, every tender sensation
doubly acute, every softening feeling alive. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
the object of tenderness and idolatry of one, who
was the world to him, he at once finds himself
a deserted and despised being; he sees his best
and finest feelings blasted for ever, his honest
sources of pleasure and peace cut off at one stroke,
with the terrible aggravation that the hand to which
alone he could look for comfort and healing under
the wound of calamity, instead of being stretched
out to save him, itself lodges the dagger in his
breast.</p>

<p>He is now alone. The ties which bound him to
existence, cruelly loosened before, are torn for ever
by this last, worst stroke. The prospect which
before warmed his heart, is narrowed and darkened
on every side. The journey of life is before him
dreary and comfortless. The weary path of
rugged labour remains to be trodden, when the
motives of activity and the rewards of exertion
have ceased to exist, when the keenness of expectation
can no longer be stimulated, and the spirit
of enterprize has subsided into sullen indifference.
While he ruminates with agony on the past, he
cheerlessly looks forward to a gloomy futurity,
and his foreboding mind sees, in the ruin of his
first and fondest hopes, the nothingness of the
visions of imagination, the destruction of the
thousand little schemes and prospects suggested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
by an honest ambition, which the exultation of an
heart untouched by calamity had fondly and fearlessly
indulged. The recollection of those delusions,
which cheated his unsuspecting youth,
whispers for ever that safety is alone compatible
with <i>apathy</i>, and cases his heart in impenetrable
suspicion. A line of separation is drawn between
him and his species.</p>

<p><i>Deceived, insulted, wounded, from that quarter
where his heart had treasured up all hope</i>, where
his ideas of human excellence had all concentred
confidence in mankind, is in his eyes the weakness of
despicable folly, or the extreme of desperate madness.
The principles of the soul, already unsettled,
are soon shaken to their foundation. The milk of
human kindness turns fast to gall; while those
very passions, that frame of mind, which operated
the first delusion, which stamped the features of
unbounded friendship, of enthusiastic beneficence,
now all subverted, are applied to exalt the violence
of the opposite character. Under this stroke
the self-love, which might bear up against the
common weight of calamity, receives an incurable
and rankling wound, over which the soul
gloomily broods. The passions of the misanthrope
still flaming with violence, tend, as to a
centre, to the aggravation of abhorrence and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span> distrust
of his species, and he hates with a keenness
and acrimony proportioned to the strength of disappointed
feeling which marked his entrance into
life.</p>

<p>For the variety of fragrances which here is perpetually
exhaled seems somewhat divine, and beyond the power of
description; for they who are sailing by, although at a considerable

this delight; for in the season of Spring, when the wind
blows from the land, it brings with it to the contiguous parts
of the sea, the sweet fragrance of myrrh, and other aromatic
shrubs.</p>

<p>Miles Romane, Ægyptum cave, say the Sybilline books.
There are who apply the phrase to Pompey alone, who
lost his life by trusting himself in Egypt. Its better interpretation
seems to be, that the effeminacy and luxury of this
enervating country was likely to prove pernicious to the
Roman veterans, accustomed to hard fare, and rigid discipline;
and in this sense, may be applied to the arrival for
the first time of any inexperienced young man in the English

<p>A modern Gracchus.</p>

<p>See Gifford’s Juvenal, p. 38, note.</p>

<p>The Gracchi were brothers, nobly descended, and virtuously
educated, but unfortunately too ambitious. Cæsars
in short born near a century before their time. They proposed
an Agrarian law (Spencean) and to get it passed,
struck at the root of that liberty of which they professed
themselves the champions, conceiving, perhaps, with other
hasty reformers, that the end justified the means. They
were murdered with every circumstance of barbarity; Tiberius
G. in the midst of his followers, by Scipio Nasica,
and Caius G. some time after, by a mob more powerful
and more profligate than his own. The hero of this chapter
died miserably in banishment at Botany Bay, a just
victim to the offended laws of his country.</p>

<p>The subject of this chapter is well explained by an old
Greek ceremony. It was the custom at Athens to introduce
at the marriage ceremony a boy who was covered with
prickly branches, and the common acorn, and carrying in
his hand baskets full of bread; he was taught to exclaim,
εφυγον κακον, ευρον αμεινον, as much as to say, I have exchanged
the bad, that is, thorns and acorns, for good, or in
other words, for bread. Nor is it less to the purpose to
add, that these also were the terms used by those who were
initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries—εφυγον κακον, ευρον
αμεινον.</p>

Here (says the veteran) have I lived to be fourscore

<p>To this part of the work, and to this, and some of the
subsequent chapters, the title of one of the comedies of
Aristophanes might not unaptly be applied, viz. The Ecclesiazuræ,
or Women assembling themselves together. Here
they will be found assembled of all ages, ranks, conditions,
and talents, in almost every variety of that various sex:
Widows, Matrons, Virgins, Philosophers, Politicians, and
Poets. The Sexagenarian was a well-known advocate for
the sex, the reader must not therefore expect any of those
hard, wicked, and abusive adages about them, such as the
three greatest evils, are Fire, Water, Woman. There are
three things which are good for nothing without much
beating, a walnut-tree, an ass, and a woman. A man of
straw is worth a woman of gold. Three women and a
goose make a market. Fie on such vile slanderers!!!—No!
no! different opinions will be found here: the maxim
here prevalent is, that there is no paradise without women,
and that England is the paradise of women. But here a
paradox occurs. There is no country in which women
have so much influence, nor any language which contains
such numerous and abusive reproaches upon women as our
own.</p>

<p>That same Mr. Pope, who was an arch slanderer of the
sex, impudently says, that most women have no characters
at all. Here we are introduced to a lady who appears to
have combined almost every character in one. A Philosopher,
and at the same time obedient to the first impulse of
the passions. A writer on the subject of education, and yet
violating in her own person the ties of moral obligation, as
established in society. An advocate for the best principles
that can direct the human heart, and a slave to the worst.
Some of the sages of old held that the body of woman was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
formed by the good, and her mind by the evil Principle.
Such heretical doctrines will find no advocates here, although
the chapter and character before us may bring them to remembrance.</p>

<p>The reader will here be reminded of the story of Narcissus,
so prettily told by Ovid in the third book of his Metamorphoses,
and more particularly of his soliloquy on contemplating
his own image in the fountain. The lady whose
portrait is given in the chapter which precedes, and she who
is here first introduced, may be supposed to address to one
another the following words of Narcissus, having been as it
were, μια ψυχη.</p>

</div>

<p>Nay, it is not quite impossible, but as it is an observation
of one of the old commentators upon Plato, that “Furicus
Triplex indissolubilis est,” but that the third lady also may
exult at being considered as one of the honourable fraternity.</p>

<p>These three chapters contain ample matter for a modern
novel, at least of three volumes. It would be easy to introduce
a few episodes of great, and proud, and unfeeling
relations, of prospects blighted, hopes disappointed, ambition
marred, and so forth, and many a circulating library
would be made to rejoice. The only objection seems to
be, that what is here related, is true. There actually was a
female so various, so eccentric, and yet so lovely. A
doughty candidate for a generalship as fantastical, as conceited,
and as amorous; a poet, so characterized by ingenious
frenzy; relations as proud, as stupid and as unfeeling,
with under Dramatis Personæ of corresponding peculiarities.</p>

<p>The ancients had some very perverse and out of the way
phrases about women. They would sometimes talk of a
Chalcidian wife, which is variously interpreted, as meaning
a very prolific wife, or as applying to one who is the cause
of much contention and animosity. They had also a saying
of a Thessalian wife, which meant neither more nor less
than a witch. They would also wickedly say, that a woman
never did any thing in moderation, and that if she played at
dice, she always threw worse or better than any body else.
But of all their pithy sayings on this pithy subject, it is not
easy to find one which will apply to the character here introduced.
Terence may perhaps help us—“O pergin
mulier esse.”</p>

<p>By the way it may be asked, as a sort of desultory question,
at what period did these same Arcadians redeem their
character? In primitive times, they were considered as a
mighty stupid people, celebrated, as they afterwards became,
as poets. Athenæus tells us, that they despised music, and
refused to receive the art among them. Lucian also, in his
Treatise on Astrology, relates that they were the only people
who refused and despised it, and professed themselves to
be of greater antiquity than the moon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT.</h2>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span></p>

<p>It will not perhaps be a very easy matter,
at this period of the work, to recall the
mind of the reader from fiction to reality,
and to persuade him of the melancholy
truth, that <span class="smcap">the Sexagenarian is now
no more</span>. The circumstances attending
this event are of an interesting, almost
even of an awful nature. To engage the
attention more deeply in his narrative, and
to relieve it of the egotism attached to self-biography,
the Sexagenarian had adopted
the third person instead of the first in many
parts of the work. He had supposed that
after his death a friend had discovered a
number of scattered materials, from which
these volumes were to be formed, and had
so supplied the connecting links as to make
the history complete. In adopting this
plan, he was enabled to give the narrative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
many little lively turns, which the natural
playfulness of his mind suggested. In this
manner he had proceeded, sustaining the
character of himself and his friend, within
a few pages of the conclusion of his work,
and had even corrected the press down to
the present sheet. Little perhaps did he
think how prophetic was his plan, and that
on his own death-bed he should in reality
entrust to a friend that office, which in fiction
he had supposed to have been committed
to his care. To present these
Memoirs to the world, and explain the
peculiar circumstances under which they
are published, was the dying request of
the Sexagenarian to one who knew and
who valued his worth. He had scarcely
entered upon his sixtieth year, and had just
entitled himself to the appellation which
in his work he had assumed, when he was
suddenly called from an existence of much
bodily pain and suffering. His life had been
chequered by various events both of a
prosperous and of an adverse nature. In
the paths of literature his exertions had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
been attended with the most gratifying
success. He had moved in the first circles
of life; he had been fostered by the great,
and rewarded by the good. No man, perhaps,
of his age, possessed larger or more
varied resources of curious and entertaining
scholarship. In literary anecdote, he was
rich and fertile; in neat and appropriate
citations, he was unrivalled. His conversation
was easy, elegant, and communicative;
and no scholar could leave his company
without an addition to his stock of
knowledge. As a friend, he was respected
and beloved; among his acquaintance, indeed,
his good-humour was almost proverbial.
His open and generous nature
was too often a dupe to the treacherous,
and a prey to the designing. His latter
days were spent in retirement from those
busy scenes, in which he had formerly
borne a conspicuous part. In the last two
years of his life, he amused himself with
the composition of the preceding Memoirs,
which display an extensive knowledge of
the events and the characters of a former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
day. Many of the personages there described,
like the hand which records them,
are now in the dust, and have left their
name only and their memories behind.</p>

<p>Would the reader enquire the end of the
Sexagenarian; would he know how a life
so spent was concluded; let him be assured,
that his last hours were those of a good
and pious man; that he departed in the
same faith and fear in which he had lived.
And happy will he be, who, after a life so
actively and so usefully employed, shall
repose upon a death-bed so calm, and so
Christian, as that of the <span class="smcap">Sexagenarian</span>.</p>
